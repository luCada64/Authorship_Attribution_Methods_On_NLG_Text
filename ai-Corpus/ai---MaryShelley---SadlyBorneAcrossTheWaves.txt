Sadly borne across the waves,
By moonlit ghost of whispered graves,
Lies the solemn heart that braves,
The whisper of the gales.

Glimmer tears in ocean's swell,
Secrets, fearful tides dispel,
Beneath the moon, bedecked in spell,
Doth sorrow weave her tales.

Oft, the stars in anguish sigh,
To think of dreams in darkly sky,
Where hopes like embers come to die,
And winds of fate bewail.

Ships of shadow, tempest-tossed,
Carry souls in ruins lost,
Amidst the icy tomb of frost,
Their spectral essences pale.

Beyond horizons, dusk and dawn,
Mournful echoes come and gone,
In shadows deep, an eerie song,
Doth nightly winds regale.

On forlorn waters, spirits fade,
Past the edge where twilight's wade,
To realms of silence, softly laid,
In mourning's gentle veil.

Sadly borne across the waves,
By moonlit ghost of whispered graves,
In hearts forlorn that memory saves,
Lies the sorrow none assails.
