**A Dirge**

When twilight falls in somber shrouds,
And whispers wane in shadowed crowds,
O'er moors where spectres phantom-wrought,
In mournful dirge, frail souls are caught.

The wailing wind doth weave its tale,
In pitch of night, where mourners pale,
’Neath weeping willows bent and gray,
Where sorrowed hearts in anguish lay.

The stars in heaven, veiled and dim,
Seem but to echo sorrow's hymn,
As pale moonlight’s ghostly rays,
Illuminate life’s fleeting haze.

No laughter now within the grove,
Where once sweet birds in gladness roved,
Their melodies have turned to sighs;
Lost in the mist of tearful eyes.

O shadows deep, thy cold embrace,
Reflects the grief on every face;
For every spirit laid to rest,
Leaves aching voids in each frail breast.

O voices spectral, soft and low,
Sing of the pain all mortals know;
For time doth steal with cruel stealth,
Each echo of our fading health.

Thus in the night, with mournful tone,
Where graves and ghosts now make their home,
Remember we the fleeting breath,
The haunting song, the shroud of death.

As dawn’s light breaks the spectre’s veil,
And softens woe’s relentless wail,
Still doth our hearts in sorrow gird,
And sing the woeful, timeless dirge.
