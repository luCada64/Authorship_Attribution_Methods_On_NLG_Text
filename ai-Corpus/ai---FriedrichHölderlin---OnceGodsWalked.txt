Once Gods Walked...

E'er vivid torrents flood, the earth did quiver fair,
Where once the gods, with sacred footsteps rare,
In their august and hallowed dance did weave,
The fates of men, beneath the laurel's eve.

Oh, blissful dawn, when ether's golden breath
Bestowed its kiss upon the fields of Hyacinth,
To mingle with ambrosial notes of truth,
And tender memory, untouched by death.

In luminous and silent groves, they spoke,
With tongues of stars and hearts of ancient oak,
Their voices timeless, echoed through the glades,
Where mortals lingered long among the shades.

The silver streams, once fathomed by their care,
No longer sing the hymns that spirits share.
Through veils of mortal dreams, the whispers fade,
Of days when heaven and earth in concord played.

Yet still, a shadow lingers in our bones,
A secret thrall within our marrow's tones.
When twilight calls and nightâ€™s deep velvet shrouds,
We feel the thrum of those ethereal crowds.

For though the gods have wandered past our sight,
Their essence holds the world in quiet light.
In every breath, a trace of divined grace,
Reminds us of the once celestial place.

Where longing hearts in tranquil union, yearn
For days when gods composed this lovely urn.
May whispers of that sacred golden thread,
Conduct the dreams where ancient spirits tread.

So gaze upon the stars, on nights so vast,
Remembering when gods walked with us, past.
Though years dissolve, yet still their myths endure,
Within our hearts, their purity is sure.
