Patmos

When shade unveils the trembling light
In sacred groves where time is stilled,
Where sacred rivers in their might
With divine whispers hearts they fill—
There, beneath the star-embroidered skies,
In silence lies the ancient isle,
Where earth and heaven harmonize,
In visions clear and undefiled.

Upon these rocks of silver foam,
Where Titans weep in waves of lore,
I wander through my thought's vast home,
Bound by the dreams of yesteryore.
Here, where the gods once walked in grace,
Their laughter echoes in the wind,
And, in this holy, hallowed space,
The sphinxes of my soul rescind.

Ye, islands steeped in mythic sleep,
Secret paths through ether traced,
Adorned by silent memories deep,
Where mortals scarce their lives effaced.
In Patmos' bosom, soft and wide,
I seek the wisdom of the earth,
Where all my griefs at last subside,
And yield to hope's eternal birth.

Oh, xanadu of ancient days,
Oft shadowed veil of reverent blight,
Guide me through thy mystic maze,
To taste truth’s transcendent light.
In holy seclusion stands thy shrine,
A beacon for the seeking heart,
Where wisdom’s vines and visions twine,
And whisper truths no tongues impart.

So, may I dwell in peace profound,
In Patmos' silent, sacred fold,
Where no earthly echoes resound,
And mysteries of hearts unfold.
For here within this Eden’s night,
Beneath skies luminescent pale,
I find my soul’s eternal light,
In timeless Patmos' whispered tale.
