**FEDERALIST No. 5: The Same Subject Continued (Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence)**

*To the People of the United States,*

In continuation of the subject addressed in my preceding paper, I venture to lay before you further reflections upon the critical matter of foreign force and influence. It is essential that we, as a nascent nation, appreciate the gravity of our present circumstances and the perils that accompany the fragmentation of our union.

The condition of human societies throughout history plainly illustrates a truth that the division of any form of political unity renders it vulnerable to those very external threats we most wish to forestall. It is not idle speculation, but the sober consideration of past events, that compels us to examine the consequences that invariably follow when territories with shared interests stand separated and defenseless against common foes.

Our predecessors, the ancient republics of Greece and the states of Italy, afford us stark lessons in this regard. Consider the fate of those democracies, once famed for their wisdom, valor, and culture: their disunited policies, fueled by mutual jealousy and discord, left them as easy prey to the growth of Macedonian and Roman power. Thus, an otherwise capable people, divided and quarrelsome, fell subject to the sword of ambitious conquerors.

The same ill-fortune awaited the disunited states of Italy. The rise, fall, and subjugation of these city-states to despots and foreign powers sprang from their failure to coalesce into a singular, formidable entity. Their internal divisions rendered them susceptible to external manipulation, wholly incapable of defending even their very liberty.

The plight of disunited entities rings a forewarning to our ears as we stand at a pivotal juncture. The neighbors about us, with their keen interests and political maneuvering, observe our evolution with vigilant eyes. European powers, with far more seasoned armies, wealth, and influence, cast their scrutinizing gaze upon us. They recognize the potential a thriving and unified America holds, for better or worse. To these potentates, our success symbolizes a challenge to their established world order, an order that has been maintained through casting doubt among rivalries and enfeebling the nascent.

What protections, what assurances do we offer ourselves if we lay supine and disjointed? Should we lapse into a disunion, we appeal directly to the ambitions of these external entities, handing them an invitation to interfere in our affairs, to play the arbiter of our destiny. Rival confederacies, entangled by conflicting interests and prone to mutual animosity, would discover themselves in a perpetual state of vulnerability—one faction soliciting aid from without against the other, each eventuating in the same tragic outcome: our sovereignty thus compromised, our liberty at grave risk.

Thus, I must enjoin upon you, fellow citizens, to eschew any strategy that would lead to internal fracturing or the diminishment of a robust federal structure. Avarice, ambition, and passion must yield to the salutary demands of unity. To forestall the designs of foreign ambition, we must gird ourselves in an indissoluble fabric—a single, unified nation. Only with such solidarity can we hope to repel external threats, secure our liberty, and foster our prosperity.

In conclusion, let this be our resolve: to build a more perfect union, to stand as a singular, formidable American Republic, so that the perils that befell the ancients owing to their divisions may serve as a cautionary tale rather than our lived experience. In unity lies the shield of our defense and the foundation of our enduring strength.
