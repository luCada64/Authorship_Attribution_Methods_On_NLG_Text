To the People of the United States,

It has been asked, and not without reason, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force. If there is any truth in the axiom that an enlightened people will respond to fidelity in the administration as light responds to its source, then the present moment demands both our deliberate engagement and our earnest application.

The Constitution that has been submitted to the candid consideration of the People of the United States thus presents itself for judgment. It is a signal moment in the annals of our national existence. Here, in this grand experiment, we face the palpable choice between the stability and liberty that a well-constructed Union promises and the chaos and contention that the alternative threatens. We must not overlook that America stands at a critical juncture. The inefficacy of the system now in place has been rendered manifest, if not ruinous. Yet, as we venture upon remedy, it is imperative that we are guided by reason and justice rather than emotion and prejudice.

I am no stranger to the struggles and tribulations that have given birth to the Federal Union. Nor am I naive to the passions and interests which invariably intersect at the heart of political deliberation. Indeed, those who pursue the establishment of government must do so with a sober recollection of human nature itself, which, perhaps more often than it ennobles, predisposes men towards selfish ends and factional rivalries.

The plan now under review, the new Constitution, is not the product of unprincipled ambition nor of sinister intrigue. It is an endeavor derived from profound consideration and the collective wisdom of your most experienced and venerable figures. It stands upon the recognition that unity is indispensable to our safety, our prosperity, and our liberty. The vigor of the government must be proportioned to the extent of its domains and the variety of its concerns, to shield them from internal conflict and external subjugation.

Notwithstanding, I am fully apprised that this proposal, however well-intentioned and judicious, will be met by opposition. It is a common fate for every plan that aims to reconstitute the fabric of government to encounter resistance from those vested in the present order or motivated by apprehensions and misconceptions. The opponents of innovation, cloaked in the garb of tradition, will prognosticate disaster for any reform, howsoever favorable and solid its foundation may be. 

But let us not be deterred by such contentions. Rather, let us engage the merits of this constitutional framework with firm resolve and honest inquiry. The Federalist Essays here presented will lay bare the principles that underpin this Constitution, scrutinize its structure, and elucidate its provisions. Thus, through reasoned discourse, we shall illuminate the true character of this grand proposal and dispel the mists of skepticism and fear.

It is perhaps only through rigorous debate and thorough examination that we may hope to secure the blessings of free governmentâ€”and secure them for ourselves and our posterity. The choice before us is formidable indeed: unity or disunion, harmony or discord, strength or weakness. As we navigate this momentous decision, let us proceed with both the gravity and the hope it warrants. 

To preserve and enhance the blessings we have fought so dearly to obtain, let us commit ourselves to the sober consideration of this proposed Constitution, letting neither prejudice nor passion stand in the way of our duty to posterity and the principles of free government.

Thus begins our essential scrutiny of the great question before us.

Alexander Hamilton,
Publius
