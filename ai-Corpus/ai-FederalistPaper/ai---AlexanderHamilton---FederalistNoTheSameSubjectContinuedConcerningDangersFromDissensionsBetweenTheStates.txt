### FEDERALIST No. 7

The Same Subject Continued (Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States)

1787

By Alexander Hamilton

To the People of the State of New York:

It has been my endeavor, in preceding papers, to lay before you a comprehensive view of the manifold dangers that would attend a disunion of these States. In continuance of this exertion, I shall now aim to elucidate further the pernicious consequences that may result from dissensions between the independent States which might emerge from the dissolution of our confederacy.

Before delving into specifics, let us reflect upon the general principle that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. A fragmented America, divided into various confederacies or sovereignties, would be considerably less formidable, not only in terms of defense but also in regard to commerce, negotiation, and internal tranquility. The perils associated with a fractured union are manifold and almost incalculable.

One immediate and palpable danger lies in territorial disputes. The boundaries of many States are at present unsettled, and the claims over certain tracts of land are contested. If the Union were to dissolve, these altercations would no longer be amiably resolved in the chambers of Congress but rather on the fields of battle and through the tumult of discord. 

Consider the case of the vast territories to the west of the Appalachian Mountains. These lands are coveted by several States and nations. Were we not united, expeditions and counter-expeditions from rivalling States would be incessant, leading to outright warfare. The inhabitants of these territories, as freedmen, would be caught in an unending nightmare of conflicting claims and ceaseless hostility.

Commerce too, would significantly suffer. Trade regulations, tariffs, and navigational rights would become singularly complex matters. Borders would teem with customs officials and soldiers ensuring the policies of their respective States were stringently enforced, thus impeding the natural flow of goods and frustrating industrious enterprise. Protracted disputes over navigational rights, particularly concerning the Mississippi River, would become almost inevitable. This vital waterway is essential for early Western settlers to transport goods to market.

Moreover, foreign powers would seek to exploit our divisions. It is no secret that the court of Britain and other European powers have long sought to sow discord across our territories. Imagine a scenario whereby they align themselves with one State against another, thus entangling us further in their imperial strife, diminishing our sphere of sovereignty and independence. 

Let us not overlook the specter of despotism that frequently follows on the heels of anarchy. In times of unceasing turmoil, the public may ultimately relinquish their liberties for the promise of peace, thereby installing tyrants who would then exploit the people’s fragilities to establish autocratic rule. History has indeed demonstrated this cycle of democracy devolving into disorder, leading to despotism.

Further calamities might arise from monetary disputes. The diverse currencies, fluctuating valuations, and conflicting financial regulations precipitated by independent States would create a climate of economic instability. Commerce would be forced to navigate an ever-changing labyrinth of financial edicts, severely constraining economic progress.

In conclusion, a disunited America would undoubtedly invite all the evils which the disunion of chapters has occasioned in every age and country—a cascade of disputes over territory, disrupted commerce, foreign manipulation, degeneration into despotism, and financial turmoil. The imperative for a robust, centralized federal government cannot be undervalued. Let us eschew these potential adversities by embracing a Union defined by mutual respect, common laws, and a shared dedication to the welfare of all.

To you, citizens of this nascent nation, I appeal—to cultivate foresight and concord, and to recognize that our collective fortunes are inextricably linked. United, we flourish; divided, we fall.
