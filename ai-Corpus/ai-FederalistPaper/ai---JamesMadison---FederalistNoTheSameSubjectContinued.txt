**FEDERALIST No. 38: The Same Subject Continued**

*The Incoherence of the Objections to the New Plan Exposed*

To the People of the State of New York:

In preceding papers, my endeavor has been to elucidate the vital necessity for a robust and fortified Union, examining the multiplicity of benefits derived thereof and countering the myriad fallacies posited against its establishment. In continuity of this rationale, it becomes imperative to address with due severity a peculiar stratagem found amply in the arsenal of dissent: an incoherent and fragmented opposition to the new Constitution.

It is a quintessential truth, sanctioned by the testimony of history and the immutable laws of human nature, that innovation, particularly in governance, invites contention and disquietude. This is neither an aberrance nor calamity but a testament to the thoughtful discourse essential for the sound construction of civil societies. Alas, what must be lamented with equal fervor is opposition marked less by reasoned critique and more by a rudderless cacophony of contradictions and hyperboles.

Obsessing, as they do, over superficial inconsistencies and imagined tyrannies, the critics have situated themselves upon a precarious foundation devoid of logic and foresight. Such incoherence can scarcely be expected to yield any beneficial outcome, but rather sows the seeds of discord amongst well-meaning citizens, vacillating their allegiance to a cause that stands upon the precipice of realization.

One notable contention posits an undue consolidation of power at the federal level to the detriment of State sovereignties. This grievance presupposes an inherent incapability of the States to exercise discretion and governance within their spheres—a presupposition both unfounded and self-refuting. For if our States are too feeble to resist this imagined tyranny, then it is they, indeed, who necessitate the guiding hand of a Union stronger and more cohesive. Conversely, if strong and capable, their vigor will adapt to the collaborative ethos defined by the Constitution, one buttressed by duties and rights clearly delineated and mutually respected.

Another charge levelled with equal vehemence is the alleged deficiency in representation within the proposed framework. Yet, it is indubitable that the plan provides a mechanism, republican by nature and reflective of the populous will more precisely than any existing system. The House of Representatives, directly elected by the People, stands proved as a bulwark against potential usurpations, while the Senate, annexing thoughtfulness to impetuosity, ensures a composure and stability vital to republican governance.

Furthermore, the delineation of powers between the varying branches, namely the Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary, demonstrates a masterful balance. It is born not of caprice but circumspect consideration of human fallibility and ambition. Those who inveigh against this composition overlook the instructive analysis of historical precedent, which exhibits governance deaths by despotism or anarchy, each born of systems either too concentrated or too diffusely weak.

In their vehemence to resist progress, objectors invoke the specter of factionalism, a divisive force considered capable of rending the Union asunder. They dismiss the intricacies designed to mitigate such dangers, as if the aggregation of collective wisdom enshrined in the convention were a mere trifle. The new Constitution, by means of its federal structure, seeks to obstruct the avenues through which factionalism might sow discord, balancing interests, and ensuring equitable representation.

To validate these arguments, let us not forget the primary object of government: to secure the felicity of its citizenry. A divided America invites contention from without and cripples endeavor from within. The cohesive and well-devised system proposed offers the greatest bulwark against the vicissitudes of fortune and folly.

In surmise, it behooves an enlightened people, particpants in their governance, to transcend the disingenuous alarms raised by incoherent opposition and to recognize the soundness and sagacity embedded within the proposed plan. It is neither perfection that we seek nor claim but a firm stride towards a more prosperous, free, and united Republic.

With fidelity and determination, let us therefore resolve to endorse this laudable charter, ensuring the security and prosperity of ourselves and our posterity—in union there is strength, and from strength, the promise of a sterling tomorrow.

Publius
