**FEDERALIST No. 18: The Same Subject Continued (The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union)**

**For the New York Packet. 1787**

To the People of the State of New York,

In the preceding examination of the inherent defects of the current Confederation, I endeavored to prove by numerous examples from antiquity and our own experiences, that an association of states loosely bound by a feeble central authority is but a fragile edifice, unfit to withstand the caprices of time and turmoil. By retracing the ruinous paths trod by confederacies past, we encapsulate the essential need for a robust Union, endowed with the vigors of an adequately empowered central government.

A recurrence to history highlights the fragility of loose leagues. Consider the Amphictyonic Council of Greece, an assembly that sought to unite various city-states for common defense and mutual benefit. It is chronicled that the very instrument designed to cement bonds among these states inadvertently became the source of discord. The council, ineffectually structured and inadequately empowered, degenerated into factional strife. Member states, animated by parochial self-interests, leveraged the council's inadequacies to curtail collective security, precipitating the decay of Greek unity and eventually leading to the subjugation of Greece under the Macedonian yoke. This melancholy narrative underscores how the insufficiencies of a weak confederation portend the dissolution of its composing entities.

Shifting our contemplation to the Achaean League, we observe a fleeting success compromised by inherent weaknesses. Initially, the league demonstrated a measure of effectual governance, yet it eventually succumbed to the same ills that plagued the Amphictyonic Council. Athens and Sparta, animated by their ancient jealousies and the league’s impotent central authority, reasserted their dominance, often to the league’s detriment. The insufficiency of the league to enforce unity and quell internecine hostilities rendered its downfall inevitable, serving as a poignant testament to the hazards of feeble centralization.

The Germanic body, although more contemporary, presents another lesson in the follies of inadequately powered federations. The Holy Roman Empire, cobbled together by a confederacy of elective monarchs and independent states, ostensibly sought collective strength. But its inability to regulate commerce, mediate disputes, or provide for common defense has rendered it a nest of disunity and recurring inadequacies. Outfitting itself with the trappings of power yet bereft of substantial authority, it binds its states in name only, failing to mitigate the fragmentations induced by local despotism and external pressures.

Turning from illustrative histories to our present circumstances, we discern troubling parallels. The Articles of Confederation, the paramount instrument of our governance, betrays our nascent republic by reiterating the errors of these bygone confederacies. Its inadequacy in securing federal compliance, sufficiency in coercing contributions for the public good, and inefficacy in resolving interstate disputes have rendered it a constellation of disjointed sovereignties rather than a United States. The impotence of Congress under this model is evident, as it cannot maintain an army, regulate interstate commerce, nor compel states to meet their obligations.

None can deny that for a nation composed of an extensive and diverse populace to thrive, it must be anchored by a government possessing necessary vigor. Irrigated by the principles of democratic consent, such a government must harness the energies of a united nation, ensuring equitable justice, fostering economic prosperity, and providing for defense against external aggression. The insufficiencies currently tarrying our confederation beckon us not merely toward remedy but toward transformation; not merely toward repair but toward reforging the structure itself.

Thus, the synthesis is clear. To avert the fate of the fragmented leagues of yore and to illuminate a path of enduring unity and strength, a new Constitution must be framed and adopted. This blueprint must endow the federal government with the requisite powers to act decisively in the national interest while retaining the just spirit of representation and liberty inherent in our republican ethos. It falls upon us to heed the lessons of history, to rectify the deficiencies of our confederation, and to forge a Union capable of preserving the liberties, security, and prosperity for the people of these United States.

With fervent hopes for our commonweal and an earnest appeal to the collective wisdom of our citizens, I submit these reflections for your discerning consideration.

James Madison
