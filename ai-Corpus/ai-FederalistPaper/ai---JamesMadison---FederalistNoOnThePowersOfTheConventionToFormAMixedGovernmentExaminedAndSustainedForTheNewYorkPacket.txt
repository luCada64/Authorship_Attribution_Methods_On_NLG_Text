**FEDERALIST No. 40: On the Powers of the Convention to Form a Mixed Government Examined and Sustained**

**For the New York Packet.**

**1788**

To the People of the State of New York,

It is an undeniable axiom, evident to the diligent observer, that to ascertain the propriety of any governmental innovation, one must examine the authority by which such changes are proposed and the utility to which they are directed. In light of the robust discourse accompanying the elaboration of the Constitution, it becomes imperative to contemplate the powers conferred upon the Constitutional Convention and the judicious exercise thereof. It is in the disquisitions of these conventions that we arrive at the foundation of a mixed government which benefits from the amalgamation of diverse forms, synthesizing the strengths while mitigating the weaknesses of each.

At the heart of the deliberation stands the inquiry: Did the Convention overstep its mandate in proposing our new Constitution? Let us first elucidate the nature of the said mandate. The delegates were entrusted with a sacred duty to propose amendments to the Articles of Confederation aimed at rendering the structure of our Union more capable of fulfilling the ends of society—security, liberty, and prosperity. The exigencies of our national distress necessitated not mere amendments, but profound reform—it required transformation.

Critics assert that the Convention exceeded its authorization by devising an entirely new framework. However, it is crucial to discern the true nature of their instructions. The true power wielded by the Convention was enshrined in the goals outlined by the commissions from various states, delegating their representatives to render the federal compact sufficient to the exigencies of governance and defense against internal and external threats. It would be an affront to reason and patriotism to argue that adherence to technicalities should eclipse the substantive goal of perpetuating a functional and flourishing republic.

In examining the essence of the mixed government proposed, let us recall the historical exemplars from which the concepts have drawn inspiration. The experiment in forming a government that amalgamates monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy must be reviewed not by the labels themselves, but by the principles of balance, representation, and separation of powers they collectively embody. The formation of an Executive imbued with sufficient energy to prosecute laws, a bicameral legislature striking a balance between egalitarianism and federalism, and a judiciary endowed with the impartiality requisite to adjudicate disputes—these elements, in concert, form the bedrock of the proposed Constitution, fashioned to navigate the complexities of governance in an expanse as considerable and diverse as our own.

One must consider the alternatives posited against the Constitution. If it is rejected under the pretense of improper mandate, what course remains? Shall we resign to the enervation of the Articles and gamble the future robustness of our Union? Or shall we recognize the Convention's wisdom in transcending mere amendments to conceive a consolidation of powers optimized for the challenges of representation, governance, and federal integrity?

Indeed, it was prudent and sagacious for the Convention to propose a system that consolidates the national spirit yet preserves the pillars of liberty and justice. The Constitution they propose is not an overreach but rather a necessary expansion—a judicious enhancement—of the compact by which we govern ourselves.

In conclusion, let us not be swayed by the diatribes of those proclaiming overreach where there is providence. The Convention acted within the bounds of its true directive—ensuring the survival and prosperity of our confederation. As such, the new Constitution signifies not a dereliction but a fulfillment of the entrusted mandate. It is a constitution designed to marry the principles of mixed government with the peculiarities of American ingenuity and exigency, standing ready to secure our liberties, promote justice, and ensure domestic tranquility.

With sincerity and profound conviction,

Publius
