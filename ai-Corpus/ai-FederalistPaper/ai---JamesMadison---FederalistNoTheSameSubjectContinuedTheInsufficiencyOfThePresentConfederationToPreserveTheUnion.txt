**FEDERALIST No. 20: The Same Subject Continued (The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union), 1787**

Authored by James Madison

To the People of the United States:

In my previous dissertations, I endeavored to elucidate the intrinsic weaknesses inherent in our present Confederation—those critical fissures which threaten the very fabric of our fledgling Union. It is to this exigent theme, province of utmost importance, that I dedicate this continuation. The persistent insufficiency of our existing structure compels a rigorous examination and a resolute appeal to reason and necessity.

Confederacies of sovereign states, history reveals, have been unsuccessful. The Amphictyonic League of ancient Greece, despite its initial auguries of cooperation, fell victim to discord among its members. Tyranny and internal factionalism undermined its efforts, producing a pernicious cycle of internal strife. This example, distant yet pertinent, must not be consigned to the detritus of memory but regarded as a cautionary archetype.

Our own Union, under the Articles of Confederation, manifests analogous vulnerabilities. The absence of a coercive power to enforce compliance amongst the states renders the resolutions of Congress impotent. What consequence does an edict possess if not accompanied by the means of its execution? Laws, no matter how benevolent in their conception, are of little utility without the imperative force to effectuate their observance.

Moreover, the requisite unanimity for substantial measures perpetuates a paralysis by indecision. When one state can defy the collective will of the others, the resultant anarchy and impotence prevent the realization of concerted action essential for common defense and mutual prosperity. The notion that each state should exercise absolute sovereignty while part of a confederation serves only to disjoint and disrupt. It is a paradox to preserve union through a framework that encourages disunion.

Additionally, the desultory revenue contributed by states under our current system is woefully deficient for the maintenance of an effective national government. The lack of a centralized authority to levy taxes restricts congressional capacity to discharge public debts and finance general welfare. Such fiscal impotence portends grave peril, rendering the treasury barren and the credit of the Union despicable.

The Union’s impotence extends to foreign relations and defense. Without a consolidated authority capable of command, the United States are vulnerable to external threats. The episodic contributions of states, dictated more by convenience than by consistent obligation, leave the nation perennially unprepared. Should a hostile force exploit our disunity, the lamentable consequences would be immeasurable.

This confederation, though conceived with noble intentions, has proved an inadequate guardian of our collective security and liberties. Its insufficiency is neither theoretical nor abstract but observed through the continual attrition of federal influence. The indispensability of a more vigorous and more centralized union, empowered with genuine authority to fulfill its designated functions, becomes manifestly imperative. 

It is incumbent upon us to reflect deeply upon the lessons history imparts and to rectify the present deficiencies before they become the progenitors of our demise. To sustain the union of states and to ensure the common good, decisive reform toward a stronger federal structure is undeniably necessary.

In conclusion, the insufficiency of our present confederation to preserve the union is not a conjecture but a discernible reality. Let prudence, courage, and foresight guide us in constructing a government empowered to unify, defend, and prosper. The choice before us is stark: to secure the blessings of liberty through a fortified union or to succumb to the disarray of a fractured confederacy.
