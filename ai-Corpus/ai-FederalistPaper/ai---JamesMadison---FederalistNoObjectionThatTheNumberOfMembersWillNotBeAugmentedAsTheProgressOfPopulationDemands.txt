**Federalist No. 58: Objection That The Number of Members Will Not Be Augmented as the Progress of Population Demands., 1788**

To the People of the State of New York:

In the ongoing discourse on the architecture and adequacy of our nascent Republic's representative framework, a vital objection has arisen that demands judicious examination. Critics postulate that the proposed structure, enshrined within the Constitution, fails to ensure the progressive augmentation of Representatives in response to the burgeoning tide of population growth. To wit, the contention is that as our population proliferates, the House of Representatives will become an inadequate reflection of the people's will, leading to oligarchical tendencies and a pernicious concentration of power.

In addressing this objection, it is paramount to consider the foundational principles upon which our proposed system stands and the inherent mechanisms designed to counteract the very concerns brought forth by the critics. Central to this discussion is the principle that the House of Representatives shall be a living institution, capable of organic and responsive growth corresponding to demographic changes.

**The Mechanism of Apportionment:**

The Constitution stipulates a decennial census, which serves as the cornerstone for apportioning representation among the states. This constitutional mandate ensures that representation remains equitable and adjusted to reflect the population shifts and expansions. The authors of the Constitution, cognizant of the inherent dynamism of a growing nation, embed this census requirement to avert the very stagnation feared by the detractors.

**The Capacious Nature of the Legislative Body:**

It is suggested by some that the initial number of representatives is insufficient. While the original allocation of 65 members may appear modest within the context of potential future expansiveness, this configuration is merely an initial condition, not an immutable state. The Constitution does not preclude the enlargement of the House. On the contrary, it inherently accommodates it. The principle of regular reapportionment guarantees that as the population grows, so too does the House—both in scale and in the diversity of representation.

**Guarding Against Concentration of Power:**

A critical facet of this debate is the apprehension that an insufficiently augmented House of Representatives could engender a concentration of power, thereby subverting the republican ethos. Historical precedence and the structural safeguards within the Constitution combine to assuage this concern. The divided nature of government—espousing a system of checks and balances—obliterates the potential for any single body to monopolize authority. The Senate, with its state-based representation, acts as a counterbalance to the House, ensuring that any attempt to consolidate power in the latter is untenable.

**Commitment to Representation:**

Moreover, the principle that representatives remain close to their constituents, both in spirit and in practice, is safeguarded by the periodic elections mandated by our constitutional framework. The biennial nature of elections for the House ensures that representatives remain ever mindful of and responsive to the will of the people. An entrenched relationship between the electorate and their chosen representatives preserves the fidelity of representation, even as it evolves to encompass more members.

**A Dynamic and Adaptive Framework:**

In conclusion, the objection that the number of members will not be augmented as population demands rests upon a misapprehension of the constructed adaptability of our system. The very architecture of the Constitution ensures an elastic response to demographic changes, facilitating an ever-broadening and faithful representation of the populace. The framers' foresight in legislating regular censuses and reapportionment stands as a testament to our commitment to a truly representative republic.

Thus, I submit to you, esteemed citizens, that the Constitution's provisions for augmenting the House are not static but dynamic, inherently designed to accommodate growth and prevent oligarchical drift. It is through this prism of adaptive representation that the Republic shall thrive and persist in fidelity to its foundational principles.
