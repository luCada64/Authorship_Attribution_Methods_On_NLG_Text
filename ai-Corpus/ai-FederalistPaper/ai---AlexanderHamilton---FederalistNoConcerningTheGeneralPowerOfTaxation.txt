**FEDERALIST No. 30: Concerning the General Power of Taxation, 1787**

By Alexander Hamilton

To the People of the State of New York:

In reflecting upon the essential structures that compose our government, it cannot be denied that a comprehensive and efficacious system of taxation forms the bedrock of our national stability and prosperity. This discourse aims to expound on the paramount significance of empowering the Federal Government with a general power of taxation, to secure the Unionâ€™s longevity and ensure its ability to meet the various exigencies that may arise.

It is an undeniable truth, universally acknowledged, that every sovereign state must possess the financial means to fulfill its obligations. Whether these obligations pertain to defense, welfare, or the public good, they necessitate a steady and reliable stream of revenue. It is therefore indispensable that the Federal Government should possess an untrammeled and unvarying power of taxation.

The history of mankind is replete with cautionary tales where the lack of adequate funding has precipitated the downfall of nations. Indeed, under the Articles of Confederation, this young confederacy has witnessed its own inadequacies. The current system of requisitions upon the States has proven itself to be ineffectual and replete with impediments. States, bound by parochial interests and encumbered by their own fiscal exigencies, have often neglected or refused their contributions. This inefficiency undermines the very foundation of collective security and prosperity.

Detractors might contend that a general power of taxation within the sphere of federal authority poses the specter of omnipotent governance and potential despotism. Such apprehensions, while not entirely unfounded considering the long lineage of tyrannies, must be weighed against the pragmatic realities and exigencies of governance. The power of taxation, if properly circumscribed by our Constitution and subject to the vigilant oversight of the people and their representatives, need not be feared. Rather, it should be embraced as the means to fortify and perpetuate the Union.

Moreover, it must be acknowledged that the multiplicity of taxes, judiciously administered, distributes the burden of fiscal responsibility across all strata of society. A federal system endowed with this power suitably reflects the inherent principle of equity, ensuring that each citizen and each State contributes in a manner commensurate with its capacity.

Consider too, the indispensable role of an augmented national revenue in preserving our sovereignty and independence. To remain a nation that commands respect and exercises its agency on the global stage, adequate funds must be at our disposal for national defense. Without such a capability, our young nation would be vulnerable to external threats and internal disunion, unable to protect its interests or project its influence.

Ultimately, the power of taxation by the Federal Government is not an end, but a means to the greater good. It galvanizes the strength of the Union, renders its operations effective, and maintains the welfare of all States. Any hesitation or parsimony in this regard risks relegating us back to the feeble and precarious state from whence we seek deliverance.

Thus, let us not be swayed by the obfuscations of those who would render the federal administration impotent and beleaguered. Instead, let us adjudicate wisely and endow our Federal Government with the full and effective power of taxation, secure in the knowledge that such a measure is indispensable for our collective security, prosperity, and the realization of the noble experiment that is our Union.

Respectfully submitted,

Alexander Hamilton
