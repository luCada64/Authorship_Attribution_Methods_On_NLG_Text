### FEDERALIST No. 67: The Executive Department

By Alexander Hamilton

To the People of the State of New York:

In pursuing our ongoing examination of the proposed Constitution, our focus today shifts to the delineation of the Executive Department. Amidst the zealous fervor and passionate contestation that the formation of this new federal framework has roused, it is imperative that we analyze with judicious exactitude the specifics concerning the Executive. I endeavor to dispel unfounded apprehensions and avid partisanship, which may obscure the merit of this essential component of governance.

The Executive power, as crafted by the Convention, amalgamates the necessary vigor for good governance while ensuring it remains zealously checked to avert degeneracy into tyrannical despotism. Our Constitutional architecture is predicated on a balanced allocation of power, alleviating concerns of an executive branch morphed into a monarchy reminiscent of the Crown from which we recently extricated ourselves.

**On the Nature and Tenure of the Executive:**

Critics, animated by a predilection for traditional alarmism, have cast aspersions on the proposed duration and singularity of the Executive’s term. They posit that a vested four-year term nurtures the seeds of monarchy. This, however, is a misconception. The periodicity of elections, intersected with a viable mechanism for impeachment judiciously wielded by the representatives of the people, forms a formidable bulwark against the perpetuation of power and the subversion of public liberty.

A singular executive, contrasted with a plurality, embodies decisive, prompt, and unified action. Divided councils have historically engendered dilatoriness and feebleness. Rome’s consular power, though varied in support, often languished in the shackles of factional paralysis. We must learn from antiquity’s tribunals rather than replicate their impediments.

**The Powers Vested in the Executive:**

An analysis of the specific powers vested in the Executive reveals a spectrum of authorities both essential and appropriate. It is vested with the power of command over the armed forces, a prerogative that situates the President as both the national defender and the ultimate steward of domestic tranquility. Yet, this authority is not unconstrained; it is tempered by Congress’s exclusive jurisdiction over funding and declarations of war, ensuring that the executive cannot wield militaristic ambition without representative sanction.

The power to appoint principal officers and judges further exemplifies a shared cognizance with the Senate. This symbiosis ensures that the pursuit of capable stewardship in vital offices does not devolve into partisan favoritism or nepotistic profligacy. The Executive’s role in foreign diplomacy, another cardinal function, balances the necessity of both secrecy and dispatch with the restraint of senatorial concurrence in the ratification of treaties.

**Ensuring Accountability:**

Lastly, the specter of unchecked executive power has been prudently addressed. The Constitution prescribes mechanisms for holding the Executive to account, including provisions for impeachment. An errant President, stained by maladministration or abominable crimes, will find no quarter but will be subject to the gravest scrutiny and ultimate removal by the people’s representatives. In this, we see the embodiment of republican vigilance and the rejection of unchecked dominance.

In sum, the Executive branch, carefully circumscribed within the proposed Constitution, emerges as a paragon of reform and a guardian of the Republic’s future prosperity. It embodies energy, accountability, and a judicious use of power in the service of the commonwealth. It requires neither our indiscriminate adulation nor our undue suspicion but rather our reasoned confidence in its design. With harmonious synergy between its vigor and restraint, the Executive will function as the indispensable nucleus of our federalist creation, ensuring that liberty and order coalesce for the enduring benefit of our nascent nation.

Yours in service to the noble cause of a United America,

Alexander Hamilton
