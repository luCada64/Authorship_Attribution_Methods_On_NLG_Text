# FEDERALIST No. 10: The Same Subject Continued (The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection)

## Published in the Year 1787

By James Madison

To the People of the State of New York,

The subject of previous communications has been the utility of the Union to your political prosperity. In this circumstance, it is particularly important to analyze the most dangerous adversaries of public peace seen across varying segments of political history: domestic faction and insurrection. These present persistent perils to stable and effective governance—a concern of paramount gravity referencing both recent and distant historical examples.

Among the numerous advantages resulting from a well-constructed Union, none deserves a more accurate elucidation than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction. The friend of popular governments never finds himself so much alarmed for their character and fate as when he contemplates their propensity to this dangerous vice. The instability, injustice, and confusion introduced into the public councils have, in truth, been the mortal diseases under which popular governments have everywhere perished, as they continue, by this very argument, to be as disabling as they are enduring.

By faction, I understand a number of citizens, whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community. There are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction: the one, by removing its causes; the other, by controlling its effects. 

It could never be more truly desired, however, that the causes of faction cannot be removed without thereby demolishing liberty itself. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an aliment without which it instantly expires. But it would be folly to abolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction. The actuating circumstances of mankind fall within the compass of personal and societal freedom, nurtured by varying and conflicting opinions and capacities which give rise to divergent interests.

To render these interests inviolable, the extent of the sphere must be considered paramount. A large republic renders it less probable that a formidable faction can achieve dominance, as more representatives are chosen by greater numbers of citizens, thus diluting fervent minority interests and amplifying the checks of moderating policies on diabolic ambitions. Moreover, the proliferation of varying interests and factions becomes an inherent barrier within an extended Republic. Engulfed by a largescale domain, the multiplicity of interests assures that no single faction can effectively unify and wield the power necessary to disrupt the common good.

Moreover, a robust Union acts as a safeguard against insurrection—an armed revolt or civil dissension threatening public autonomy and domestic tranquility. History documents narrowly spaced eruptions of insurrection in smaller political entities or factions, compromised by exposed vulnerabilities to demagogues and despots. Thus, a suitable national defense configuration, betokened by interposition of federated guarantee, becomes imperative to suppress or preclude insurrections.

State units, bound together in collective providence, empower the Union with consolidated defense and mitigated susceptibility to internal schisms. Such concert and concerted dominion ensure the continuum of liberty and well-being of the commonweal. This extension of the Union serves the dual aim of preserving the peace within the dominion and assisting in reforms and protections stamped by constitutional orders.

Should we deprecate foreign aggrandizers or internal agitators, it is the shield of the Union secure against fractious insurrection vigorously affixed. In every solution and bend towards promulgated virtue and steadfast administrative coherence, the Union withstands as the principal orderer of benign government.

To prevent the occurrence and curb the perturbation of nefarious factions—for the felicity and just governance of the immense expanse—I implore you, resolute and fair countrymen, confide in the evidences of Union as the providential guardian of your civil and political freedoms.

With irrevocable commitment to our burgeoning republic,
James Madison
