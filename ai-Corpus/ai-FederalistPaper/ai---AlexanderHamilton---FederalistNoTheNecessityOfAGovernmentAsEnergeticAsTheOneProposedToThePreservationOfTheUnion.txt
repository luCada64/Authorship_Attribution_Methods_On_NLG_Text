**FEDERALIST No. 23: The Necessity of a Government as Energetic as the One Proposed to the Preservation of the Union, 1787**

By Alexander Hamilton

To the People of the State of New York:

In the exigent times that call upon our fledgling nation for reflection and decisive action, it is incumbent upon us to deliberate earnestly on the nature and vigor of the government under which we reside. The fate of our Union, our liberty, and our posterity demands nothing less. 

The proposition before us is the establishment of a government endowed with sufficient energy to secure the blessings of liberty and the general welfare. In assessing this proposition, we must engage with the bare facts and exigencies facing our Confederacy, that we might wisely discern the necessity of such a government as proposed.

I put forth that the primary duties of a national government are the common defense of the members, the preservation of the public peace as well as against internal convulsions and the regulation of commerce with other nations. In order to accomplish these ends, it must possess the requisite authority over the resources requisite for the attainment of these objectives.

Firstly, let us consider the matter of national defense. Experience and reason alike dictate that any government charged with this essential duty must possess the full authority to levy armies and to build and equip fleets. Further, it must have the authority to impose taxes to defray the expenses incident to the disbursement of these resources. A government devoid of these powers is ill-prepared for any external exigencies, laying its citizens bare to the caprices and imperatives of foreign powers. The confederation under which we now dwell has shown itself deficient in this regard.

Secondly, the preservation of public peace necessitates a government that can respond swiftly and effectively to insurrections and domestic disorders. A government vested with inadequate authority or crippled by the need to secure the compliance of individual states is unwieldy and impotent. The preservation of Union and order is incompatible with such imbecilitated mechanics.

Thirdly, to regulate commerce effectively and uniformly with foreign nations—and to ensure the fair and free trading amongst the states—requires a centralized authority that speaks with one voice and enforces one law. The disparate commercial regulations of the states have fostered discord and economic inefficacy, undermining the prosperity that ought to be the hallmark of a united people.

It is thus clear that any system falling short of granting these necessary powers to the national government fails in adequacy with respect to the preservation of the Union. The American people must come to recognize that energetic government and liberty are not opposed; indeed, they are counterparts. A government dependent on the whims of constituent parts for its operation, incapable of unified action, and unable to marshal and control resources, is a government unsuited to the high responsibilities of national sovereignty.

Some among us profess an apprehension of tyranny and the encroachments upon the liberties of the people by a strong government. Yet, would it not be the height of folly—and indeed the prelude to despotism—to enfeeble our national government to the point of ineffectiveness, inviting both internal dissension and external dominance? The essence of tyranny lies not in strength but in the abuse of strength. Therefore, our safeguards against tyranny must be an appropriate and vigilant structure of checks and balances, not a government devoid of energy.

The Constitution presented to us ensures both; by fusing necessary authority for national objectives with safeguards protecting against the overreach of power. It delineates powers, counterpoises them, and designs mechanisms for their regular and just exercise. This careful composition offers the antidote to anarchy and the bulwark against autocracy.

In conclusion, the necessity of an energetic government to the preservation of the Union is evident and inexorable. If we cherish the values of liberty, peace, and prosperity, let us embrace the Constitution proposed, with all its endowment of necessary powers. Let us not cripple our future with the flawed vestiges of the present confederation but instead march forward with resolve to a robust and unified nation.

The spirit of liberty resides not in the paralysis of government but in the judicious deployment of its vital powers, ensuring the welfare and security of the republic. To this end, let this be our noble endeavor and steadfast commitment.

Yours faithfully,
Alexander Hamilton
