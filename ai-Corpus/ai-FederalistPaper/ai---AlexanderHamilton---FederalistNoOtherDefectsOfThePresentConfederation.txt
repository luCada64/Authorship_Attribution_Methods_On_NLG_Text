FEDERALIST No. 21: Other Defects of the Present Confederation

To the People of the United States:

In continuing my disquisitions upon the critical failings of our present Confederation, I endeavor to lay bare the numerous and inherent defects that render our existing government inadequate to the exigencies of a growing and diverse nation. The year 1787 compels us to reflect upon the inadequacies that jeopardize our collective prosperity and union.

It is a truth self-evident that any Confederation primarily grounded on a loose league of friendship between sovereign states is inherently fraught with discord and inefficiency. Such a system serves as a mere shadow of authority, wherein the central government lacks the necessary vigor to enforce its decrees or to bind the constituent states in a uniform course of action. This principle defect permeates every aspect of our current Confederacy.

Firstly, the absence of a centralized authority with the power to levy taxes directly upon the citizens presents an insurmountable obstacle. The current system relies upon requisitions made to the individual states, a method deficient both in justice and practicality. States, driven by parochial interests and immediate exigencies, have proven recalcitrant in meeting their financial obligations. This failing not only starves the national treasury but also undermines the credit and dignity of our young republic.

The impotence of our Confederation is further manifested in its inability to provide for a common defense. The contemporary model offers no permanent standing army or a cohesive defense strategy. Each state, left to its devices, prioritizes its own security, leaving the nation vulnerable to external threats. A fragmented and inconsistent approach to defense weakens our position vis-Ã -vis foreign powers and renders us susceptible to their machinations and incitements.

Moreover, the lack of a unifying regulatory framework for commerce exacerbates the disparities among the states. The present Confederation allows each state to impose its own trade restrictions and tariffs, which sow discord and impede the free flow of goods and services. Such a patchwork of regulations not only stifles economic growth but also breeds resentment and rivalry among the states, further fragmenting our union.

A confederal system that affords preeminence to state sovereignty over national interest inevitably curtails the ability to enact and enforce laws that serve the common good. In matters of internal insurrection, foreign invasion, and interstate disputes, the Confederation's role is reduced to that of an impotent supplicant, pleading for cooperation rather than compelling obedience. This precarious position invites challenges to our sovereignty and jurisdiction, both from within and without.

The remedy to these profound and systemic weaknesses lies not in patching up a failing structure but in the establishment of a robust and empowered central government. This new federal system must possess the authority to raise revenues directly, to regulate commerce uniformly, and to summon and maintain a standing force sufficient to ensure our security. The establishment of a federal judiciary to arbitrate disputes and uphold the rule of law is equally imperative.

In summation, a government without the means to execute its mandates is no government at all. It behoves us to rectify these deficiencies by embracing a constitution that vests adequate power in a central authority, ensuring both the durability and the efficacy of our union. Let prudence and foresight guide us in this crucial moment, lest we lose the hard-won fruits of our independence to the shackles of mismanagement and disunity.

Yours in earnest deliberation,

Publius
