FEDERALIST No. 55: The Total Number of the House of Representatives, 1788

By James Madison

To the People of the State of New York:

Among the objections to the Constitution that have been industriously circulated by its adversaries, a general and pervading one is the alleged inadequacy in the representation of the people in the House of Representatives. The fear expressed is that the total number of elected representatives is insufficient to convey the sentiments, interests, and multifarious character of the heterogeneous populace within the several states.

The magnitude of this concern merits our attention, for it strikes at the very heart of our representative democracy. But in addressing this, it is necessary to ascertain whether the number proposed is truly of such a nature as to warrant the foreboding visions it has invoked.

Let us first consider the principle that has guided our Constitution's architects: the endeavor to ensure that the House of Representatives remains both a practical and efficient body, while being genuinely reflective of the will of the people. It is neither the multiplication of representatives that augments the quality of governance nor the excessive compression of the number that ensures dispatch and celerity in legislative processes. There exists a golden mean where both efficiency and representativity are balanced.

The proposed House of Representatives, consisting initially of sixty-five members, may seem modest in scale against the extensive backdrop of the United States. To some, this number appears ill-suited to possess the diversified faculties requisite to grasp and advance the galaxy of local interests and sentiments. Yet, this apprehension requires a methodical examination, divorced from the tumultuous passions that have permeated this debate.

Historically, the practice of representation has thrived under varied numbers of representatives within legislative bodies. The British Parliament, the French States-General, and the early colonial assemblies in America exhibited a diverse array of representative scales, none of which impeded their fundamental legislative functions. Indeed, time and time again, experience has demonstrated that the quality of representation owed more to the wisdom and virtue of the elected than to their sheer number.

Moreover, it is paramount to remember that the number of representatives is not static, for the Constitution prudently provides for a decennial augmentation corresponding to the nation’s demographic expansion. In this way, the legislative body will evolve in alignment with the nation’s growth, ever recalibrating to preserve an equilibrium of representation.

Further examination reveals that the intimate relationship between constituents and their representatives, often feared to be tenuous in a smaller body, may, under these provisions, indeed be strengthened. For each representative, with a manageable constituency, can remain vigilant in eliciting the pulse of the people they serve, thus ensuring that the intricate interests and opinions of the different sections of society are neither overlooked nor eclipsed.

Finally, the illustrious Hamilton has noted the significance of quality over quantity in representation. An excessively large assembly may succumb to the vices of faction and tumult, diluting responsibility and fostering anarchy. In contrast, a more restrained assembly, with clear accountability, facilitates genuine deliberation, unity of purpose, and prudence in governance.

In conclusion, while we must heed the fears of underrepresentation, it is evident that the proposed number of the House of Representatives is neither an arbitrary figure nor an immutable one. It stems from a calculated design to balance efficiency, responsiveness, and representative fidelity. Let us not be swayed by undue apprehensions, but rather trust in the mechanisms enshrined within our Constitution to safeguard and perpetuate our democratic ethos.

Yours respectfully,
Publius
