To the People of the State of New York:

The suffrages of our voters, the tranquility of our republic, and the future prosperity of our union hinge upon the adoption of the proposed Constitution. The necessity of our union, as a bulwark against domestic faction and insurrection, demands our most earnest consideration, for without unity, we are but scattered and vulnerable territories at risk of internal strife and annihilation by external forces.

It has been considered by some, that a confederate form of governance is sufficient for the preservation of our liberties. They point to the ancient republics of Greece and Italy, whose fractious assemblies and local dissensions eventually led to their ruin. Their divisions allowed for the constant inflow of intrigue and machination, introducing councils among their adversaries, effectively pitting brother against brother. The evils of domestic faction, unchecked by a strong central authority, are manifold and perilous.

Contemporary reflections upon the failures of such ancient models of confederacy reveal a stark lesson for our own destinies. The framers of the proposed Constitution have endeavored to fortify us against similar misfortune. They have, with laudable foresight, crafted a framework that provides for a strong, central government—one able to mediate and extinguish the embers of internal discord before they blaze into ungovernable infernos of insurrection.

One might object, arguing that a large republic will only magnify the vices inherent in human societies. However, this is a misconception. The extensive territory of the United States presents numerous checks against the usurpation of power by any single faction, as it dilutes their influence across a broader heterogeneous landscape. The greater diversity of interests and factions in a large republic guards against the dominance of a single interest or faction. This diversity, when managed by a capable central authority, is a source of staunch resilience rather than fragility.

Additionally, the proposed Constitution incorporates principles of both representation and federation. It enables a more refined representation of the people in their federal councils while preserving the sovereignty of the individual states. This duality ensures that the vigor of national governance does not obfuscate the local interests which reside in the hearts of the common citizenry.

Moreover, the Constitution permits the deployment of federal forces to timely suppress insurrections and to repel invasions. Our histories speak clearly of the necessity of such provisions. Shays’ Rebellion in Massachusetts is a poignant reminder of how easily the specter of faction can grasp the throat of liberty. The Articles of Confederation left us impotent to act decisively in the face of such threats. The current proposal remedies these deficiencies by empowering the Union to act defensively and preemptively against those who would cast aside the rule of law for the rule of anarchy.

Through establishing a judiciary to adjudicate disputes between states, the proposed Constitution further cements our union. The avoidance of war between the states, so frequent and ruinous in the days of the Greek city-states, preserves our republic from another avenue of potential devastation.

In conclusion, the Union we endorse under this Constitution is more than a mere alliance of convenience; it is a meticulously constructed fortress against faction and insurrection. It envisages a nation robust and resilient, prepared to meet and overcome the adversities that imperiled our hallowed predecessors. Let us not be misled by those who, either through ignorance or deceit, decry this necessary and prudent consolidation. The preservation of our Union, the broader arc of republican liberty, and the very essence of our societal well-being depend on the wise endorsement of this Constitution.

With steadfast resolve, we march towards a more perfect union, under God and for the betterment of all.

Your faithful servant,

ALEXANDER HAMILTON
