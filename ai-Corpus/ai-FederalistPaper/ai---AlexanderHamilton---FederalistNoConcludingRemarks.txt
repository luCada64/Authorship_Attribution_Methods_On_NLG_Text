**FEDERALIST No. 85: Concluding Remarks, 1788**

**To the People of the State of New York,**

It is with a sense of duty and the gravity appropriate to the momentousness of our endeavors, that I undertake to lay before you my final reflections on the Constitution which has been the subject of detailed scrutiny and fervent debate. Indeed, it is a manifestation of the profound importance of the matter at hand that we have engaged in such thorough examination, for the framework upon which we now deliberate is to serve as the foundation for a perpetuity of governance under rational laws, advantaging our offspring, and the collective prosperity of the confederation.

In prior publications, I have endeavored to illuminate the virtues of the proposed Constitution and the distinct necessity of its adoption. Each article has aimed to disentangle the complexities of federalism, the requisites of a balanced separation of powers, and the critical imperatives of unity over the multiplicity of interests that could otherwise fracture our nascent nation. It is in the spirit of this continuance that I provide these concluding observations, urging the people of New York, and indeed, all the peoples of these United States to recognize the unprecedented opportunity before us.

Let us consider the paramount objective: consolidation of the Union. The fragmentation and discord that would result from prolonged adherence to the current Confederation is a danger too substantial to be lightly regarded or dismissed. Temporary expedients and procrastinations will no longer suffice against the exigencies of our time. The weaknesses inherent in the Articles of Confederation have borne out their inadequacy through the instabilities we have endured and the embarrassments suffered in foreign policy. An effective federal government is not a theoretical indulgence but an empirical necessity, the surest bulwark against both internal dissolution and external vicissitudes.

I contest that the proposed Constitution is constructed with an astute regard for republican integrity and the preservation of liberty. The separation of the legislative, executive, and judicial powers has been crafted to ensure that no one branch may usurp the functions of another, nor any officer exert undue dominion over the sovereign rights of the citizens. This equilibrium is not merely an abstract ideal but a practical correlate of free government.

Detractors question the potential for tyrannical aggregations of power, yet it must be acknowledged that each article and clause has been subject to robust debate and assiduous refinement to mitigate these very concerns. The provision for amendments provides a mechanism for continuous improvement – an essential feature attesting to the document’s foresight. Is it not reflective of wisdom that we install a living governance, corrigible through mandate and not revolution?

Moreover, the ratification of this Constitution engenders an immediate and lasting virtue: the elevation of public trust. This trust, essential for the operability of any government, rests upon the belief that laws and institutions ascend not from coercion but from collective assent. It is this concord that will amplify our resources, magnify our influence, and cement our domestic tranquillity.

The spirit which has prompted these papers is one of virtuous patriotism, animated with the hope of enduring felicity for our republic. I implore you not to be swayed by arguments that cry for perfection and thus reject progress. The proposed Constitution is unmatched in its facilitation of unity and good governance, and the worst folly would be to demand what is unattainable at the cost of what is achievable.

In summation, my fellow citizens, let us not falter in this critical juncture. The deliberations undertaken here reflect the arduous journey of a people destined for greatness. Let future generations look back, not in consternation at our indecision, but with admiration for our resolve. It remains for you to consider the solemnity of the charge laid upon you and to act in accordance with wisdom and prudence.

With unfailing confidence in your discernment and patriotism, I place my trust.

Your most obedient servant,

**PUBLIUS**
