**FEDERALIST No. 15: The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union (1787)**

By Alexander Hamilton

To the People of the State of New York:

It has ever been my ardent wish, fellow citizens, to engage your minds in the investigation of matters crucial to the maintenance of our Republic and the welfare of our Union. The time has come to confront a fundamental truth which, though uncomfortable, is essential for the preservation of our collective future. I refer to the glaring inadequacies inherent within our current system of government, the Confederation. My purpose herein is to elucidate the deficiencies of the existing framework and to compel the necessity of a more energetic government.

The existing Confederation errs in its presumption that the league of states, loosely united in purpose but separate in administration, can adequately address the concerns and aspirations of a burgeoning nation. To persist in such a belief is to court disaster. A cursory examination of national affairs reveals a disheartening panorama of monetary instability, faltering commerce, and international disrespect—all symptomatic of a fundamental structural weakness.

First, consider the perpetual impotence of the Confederation Congress in matters of revenue and finance. It is a glaring anomaly that a government, instituted for the common good, should lack the authority to impose and collect taxes directly from the people. Instead, it must grovel at the feet of state legislatures, beseeching them for contributions which, more often than not, are withheld or inadequately fulfilled. This leads inevitably to an empty treasury, incapable of meeting the exigencies of public exigence or upholding national credit. Is this the mark of a government vested with sufficient power to preserve the Union?

Secondly, the inability of the Confederation to regulate commerce presents a formidable impediment to national prosperity. Diverse and often conflicting state regulations have splintered our market and stunted our economic potential. Our international capacities are met with hesitation and derision by foreign powers, who see, not a strong unified nation, but a disjointed confederation of competing interests. Is it not self-evident that a singular commercial policy, enforceable by a robust national government, is necessary to make the American market vibrant and respected?

Furthermore, the current structure lacks the essential means of enforcing laws upon individuals. A republic that only issues decrees to state governments, and not directly to its citizens, is fundamentally flawed. This indirect mode of governance results in laws that are regularly ignored or inadequately enforced, eroding the principles of order and justice. For a government to be respected and obeyed, its authority must be visible and immediate. Inability to ensure compliance undermines the very essence of governance and invites anarchy.

It is no hyperbole to assert that such a system risks the dissolution of the Union. History and the experiences of other nations serve as a determined testament: weak confederations crumbled under the weight of their own inefficacies. Are we to follow in their faltering footsteps, or shall we have the prudence and courage to erect a framework capable of standing the test of time?

In acknowledgment of these perils, the time is ripe to discuss remedies befitting the gravity of our predicament. It is imperative, fellow citizens, to establish a government endowed with ample powers to achieve the ends for which it was intended—peace, security, and prosperity for the Union. The Constitution proposed by the Philadelphia Convention presents a definitive solution to the shortcomings I have outlined. It offers a government that can levy taxes, regulate commerce, and enforce laws directly upon its citizens—a government that can truly govern.

In closing, I implore you to deliberate upon the points I have raised with the seriousness they merit. The preservation of our Union, the security of our liberties, and the prosperity of our nation hinge upon our ability to move beyond the flawed structure of the present Confederation. Let us embrace a bolder, more effective system that promises to fulfill the grand potential of our collective enterprise.

Yours obediently,

Alexander Hamilton
