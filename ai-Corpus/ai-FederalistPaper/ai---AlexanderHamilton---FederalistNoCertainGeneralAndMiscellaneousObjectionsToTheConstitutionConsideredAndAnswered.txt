**FEDERALIST No. 84: Certain General and Miscellaneous Objections to the Constitution Considered and Answered**

**1788**

To the People of the State of New York:

A fresh surge of rhetoric has arisen against the proposed Constitution, encapsulating various general and miscellaneous objections which, if unaddressed, may tarnish the merit of our shared endeavors. In contending with these assertions, I aim to dispel any myths, clarify misconstructions, and fortify the arguments for ratification.

One frequent and specious criticism posits that the Constitution lacks a Bill of Rights. These critics hold that such an omission gravely endangers the liberties of the people, likening the document to a vessel adrift without an anchor. To contend with this, we must interrogate the necessity and the pragmatic sufficiency of a Bill of Rights in this context.

Precedents in our state constitutions disclose that explicit statements of privileges are not universal. For instance, the Constitution of New York itself professes no such detailed enumeration akin to the highly-vaunted English Bill of Rights. Instead, it implicitly shelters rights under the aegis of the broader framework of government. One must question: Does the absence of specification imply the negation of these rights?

Moreover, the edifice of federal power erected through the Constitution is fundamentally distinct from monarchical traditions. The Constitution is a compact, one explicitly bounded by the enumeration of powers. Anything not granted, said or implied within this enumeration is reserved, under the proposed Constitution, to the States or the people. Hence, the addition of a Bill of Rights is not merely unnecessary but redundant.

Consider the claim that trial by jury is not sufficiently preserved in civil cases. Upon close scrutiny, we would discern that different states carry different norms and practices concerning civil juries. Thus, a federal imposition would either favor certain states over others or enforce a clumsy uniformity across diverse legal landscapes.

Notably, the objection encapsulated by the absence of term limits for the president is and shall remain meritless to any objective observer. The election process itself—rooted as it is in the volition of the people—serves as a natural check against the hazards of perpetual incumbency. Term limits are an artificial constraint, whereas the people's constant vigilance imbues the executive office with accountability and dynamism.

Another oft-cited objection is that the Constitution amalgamates too much power in federal hands at the expense of state sovereignty. This argument is flawed. The distinctions between state and federal jurisdictions remain intact through enumerated powers and the robust principle of subsidiarity. The fabric of our union thrives on this balance, a harmony preordained by the deliberations of those who drafted this charter with profound sagacity.

Further objections allege the judicial branch might transgress its bounds, becoming a cloaked and unaccountable aristocracy. However, this branch—bound by the fundamental law and tempered by the legislative capacities to shape its parameters—cannot freely usurp powers without checking itself.

In summation, the safety, liberty, and effectiveness of our governance come not from excessively fettering federal powers with an overwrought Bill of Rights nor from misplaced fears of central overreach but from a rigorous and continuous exercise of republican vigilance. The Constitution achieves the delicate balance, granting enough energy to the federal government to ensure unity and functionality, while preserving essential liberties through its very structure and the virtue of its citizenry.

Herein, let us understand the Constitution not as an incomplete edifice requiring myriad patches, but as the keystone of a burgeoning republic, designed intelligently to stand the test of time, fortified by reason, and destined to secure the prosperity and liberty of its people.

Your devoted servant,
PUBLIUS
