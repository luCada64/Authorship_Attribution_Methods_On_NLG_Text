**FEDERALIST No. 80: The Powers of the Judiciary, 1788**

To the People of the State of New York:

It is with the gravity befitting our nascent republic that I, Alexander Hamilton, undertake to delineate the paramount significance of the federal judiciary in the grand tapestry of our Constitution. The establishment of a strong and independent judiciary is imperative for the preservation of justice, the safeguarding of the constitution, and the maintenance of national unity. The necessity of such a tribunal, vested with the authority to expound and interpret the laws that govern our federated union, cannot be overstated.

In this discourse, I shall urgently contend that the envisioned structure and powers of the judiciary, as outlined in our proposed Constitution, are indispensable for the adjudication of national interests, the resolution of interstate conflicts, and the protection of individual rights against encroachments by the legislature or the executive. 

First and foremost, let us consider the indispensable need for a judiciary with powers coextensive with the Constitution itself. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land; it is a compact imposing limitations and vesting powers not just on individual states but directly upon the people. For it to maintain its primacy and supremacy, there must exist a judicial body whose interpretations and pronouncements are final. It is through the lens of adjudication that doubts are dispelled, ambiguities clarified, and the uniformity of national law ensured.

One might ask, why should the federal judiciary possess jurisdiction over all cases arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties entered into under its authority? The exigency of such provision is rooted in the essence of federalism. Without a judicial umpire, states might interpret treaties and laws in idiosyncratic manners, leading to discordance and disunion. The judiciary must act as a stabilizing force, harmonizing the interpretations, thereby ensuring that a singular, coherent legal framework prevails across all states.

In matters affecting ambassadors, public ministers, and consuls, it stands to reason that such cases must fall exclusively under federal cognizance. The treatment and adjudication of these cases are often interwoven with national honor and foreign policy, areas which no single state can justly or prudently be entrusted. The same logic applies to maritime causes which affect, by their nature, parties and interests spread across various states and even beyond our national borders. The necessity for uniform rules and application in these areas is unequivocal and uncontestable.

The federal judiciary's role in controversies between two or more states, or between a state and citizens of another state, epitomizes the apex of impartial justice. It would be palpably unreasonable to expect a state judiciary to render disinterested decisions in disputes where its own state is a party. Federal courts, insulated from local biases and partialities, are the guardians of fairness and the emissaries of justice that our union necessitates.

Equally significant is the judiciary's function as a bulwark against unconstitutional legislative and executive actions. Absent such an arbiter, the principles enshrined in our Constitution would be but a fanciful dream, subject to the whims of transient majorities. The judiciary must possess the unequivocal power to declare national and state laws void if found repugnant to the Constitution, thereby fortifying the fundamental rights and liberties of the people.

Let us heed that the judiciary, unlike the sword or the purse, wields powers through judgment alone. Its implementation rests upon the executive; thus, it remains inherently the least dangerous branch, posing no threat to liberty. Rather, it stands as its staunch protector.

The very essence of the judiciaryâ€™s power lies in impartiality and independence. Judges, serving during good behavior, detached from political pressures, and imbued with the requisite authority to render binding judgments, epitomize the ideal of judicial rectitude.

It is therefore incumbent upon us, as stewards of this burgeoning republic, to embrace the establishments outlined in our proposed Constitution. The federal judiciary, as conceived, is not merely an institution but a pillar upon which the edifice of our liberty and stability rests.

Thus, upon careful contemplation and with earnest conviction, I trust that my fellow citizens will recognize the indispensability of a robust and independent judiciary: the sentinel of our Constitution, the arbiter of justice, and the custodian of our national unity.

Yours faithfully,
Alexander Hamilton
