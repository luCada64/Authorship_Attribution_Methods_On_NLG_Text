**FEDERALIST No. 13: Advantage of the Union in Respect to Economy in Government**

To the People of the State of New York:

It is a universally acknowledged truth that the security, prosperity, and happiness of a nation are inextricably linked to its economic prudence and efficient governance. In our pursuit of a more perfect Union, we must examine with care and consideration the economic benefits that are to be reaped from a consolidated government over a confederation of independent states.

I propose to elucidate in this paper how the union of the American States offers profound advantages with respect to economy in government, advantages which are crucial to the stability and prosperity of our rising republic.

Reflect, Citizens, upon the manner in which a confederated government must necessarily operate. Each state, functioning as an independent entity, would be required to maintain its own standing apparatus for governance, including separate legislatures, executives, and judiciaries. The financial burdens of supporting these multiple institutions, exacerbated by the necessity of ensuring adequate defense mechanisms in a world filled with potential threats, would fall heavily upon the citizens of each state. Aggregate these costs across thirteen distinct governments and the inefficiencies and redundancies become strikingly apparent.

In stark contrast stands a consolidated Union, wherein one central government can, with unified authority, administer the affairs of the nation. Such a government would not be subject to the duplication of administrative structures. Allow me to illustrate further with a simple comparison. Rather than thirteen sets of representatives deliberating independently upon similar matters, we would have one representative body tasked with conducting the business of the nation. Rather than thirteen separate armies and navies, each insufficient in strength, we would boast a single, well-equipped, and efficient military force poised to defend every corner of our vast territory.

The economies of scale achieved through centralization would extend far beyond mere administrative efficiency. Consider the revenue derived from taxation under a unified system. Were we fragmented, states would compete for taxable resources, leading to inequitable and inefficient tax levies, as well as an inclination towards protectionist policies which would stifle commerce and burden the productive capacities of our citizens. Unified taxation under the aegis of a central authority would not only distribute this burden more equitably but would also facilitate the growth of interstate commerce, proving a boon to the prosperity of the entire nation.

Moreover, a Union provides a framework for uniform regulations that bolster economic activities, fostering a stable environment in which businesses can thrive. The elimination of conflicting state laws and tariffs under the supremacy of federal statutes encourages a fluid and efficient marketplace. This seamless commercial environment, underpinned by a robust national infrastructure, would be unattainable under a system fragmented into rival states.

Let us not overlook the inefficiency and potential chaos imbued in the diplomatic engagements of a disjointed confederacy. Each state, seeking to establish its own treaties and alliances, would expose itself to manipulation and conflict with its neighbors. A consolidated Union, represented by a singular national government, would project strength and stability in the international arena, securing favorable trade agreements and safeguarding the interests of the nation with greater efficacy and lower expenditure.

In conclusion, it is manifest that the Union presents substantial economic advantages over the loose confederation of independent states. The consolidation of government allows for a streamlined and efficient administration, equitable taxation, uniform regulations conducive to commerce, and a fortified position in international diplomacy. In embracing the Union, we choose not only the path of strength and unity but also the promise of a prosperous future built upon the bedrock of economic prudence.

Yours in the cause of the Union,

ALEXANDER HAMILTON
