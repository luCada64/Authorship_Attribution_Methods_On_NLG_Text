### FEDERALIST No. 74: The Command of the Military and Naval Forces and the Pardoning Power of the Executive

**Publius**

**To the People of the State of New York:**

It is with utmost gravity that I address you on the dual subjects of the command of the military and naval forces and the power of pardon vested in the Executive. These two prerogatives, while seemingly disparate in nature, are united by their profound implications for the maintenance of public safety and the preservation of justice, cornerstones of any sound republic.

The Constitution has conferred upon the President the supreme command of the army and navy of the nation. This appointment is neither frivolous nor arbitrary but rather the necessary consequence of the principles of unity and effectiveness in the administration of national defense. In times of war and national emergency, the cohesion of command and the swift execution of strategies are indispensable. Divided authority in such pivotal moments would breed discord, dilute responsibility, and undermine the efficacy of defensive actions, all to the detriment of the republic.

The wisdom of vesting this power in a single figure, the President, lies in the greater capacity for swift and decisive action, unimpeded by the fractiousness and deliberative nature of larger assemblies. Unity of command ensures that military endeavors are orchestrated with harmony and precision, fostering an environment where the nation's defense might flourish unimpeded by the vagaries of factionalism.

The provision for the President's role as Commander-in-Chief is complemented by another significant power: the power of pardon. This executive privilege allows the President to temper justice with mercy, offering relief from the rigors of law where its inflexible application might yield undue suffering or where equity demands leniency.

While some might argue that the power to pardon is an anachronistic vestige of monarchical prerogative, let us consider its invaluable role within our republican framework. The justice system, though predicated on principles of fairness and due process, is not infallible. Courts, composed of men, may err in judgments, and laws, being general in application, may inflict undue hardship upon individuals whose circumstances might warrant clemency.

The President, as the nation's chief magistrate, is uniquely positioned to ascertain instances where the dispensation of mercy would serve the public good or rectify wrongs perpetrated against persons wrongly condemned or excessively punished. Such instances are relatively rare, and the capacity to address them should reside in an authority whose encompassing view of the nation's welfare can balance these concerns with wisdom and prudence.

Moreover, the power of pardon can serve as a tool of reconciliation in the aftermath of civil strife or widespread insurrection. It can restore social harmony by extending mercy to those who, having been vanquished or having repented their transgressions, can be reintegrated into the civic polity without compromising the republicâ€™s foundations.

In granting these powers to the President, the Constitution adheres to the dual principles of concentrated responsibility and the harmonious interplay of mercy and justice. The unitary command of military forces ensures national defense is conducted with utmost efficacy, while the power to pardon allows the application of laws to be buffered by compassion and equity. Through these provisions, our republic safeguards its security and preserves its moral and ethical integrity, demonstrating a balance between force and mercy.

Thus, my fellow citizens, we must regard these Constitutional provisions not as mere relics of monarchical power, but rather as essential instruments for the governance and welfare of our burgeoning republic. By entrusting these powers to the executive, we are not venerating tyranny but preventing it, ensuring the smooth and just administration of defense and justice alike.

Let us then cherish the wisdom embedded within the structure of our Constitution, recognizing that through the vesting of these pivotal powers in the office of the President, we fortify the resilience and moral fortitude of our union.

**Publius**
