# FEDERALIST No. 70: The Executive Department Further Considered, 1788

**To the People of the State of New York:**

In pursuance of my engagement to illustrate and to recommend the Constitution and its principles, particularly as they relate to the vital branch of our governance—the Executive Department—I now present to you deliberations focused upon this indispensable pillar of republican liberty and effective administration.

It shall be my endeavor to establish, with the utmost clarity and compelling force, the necessity of a robust executive office constituted to serve and protect the interests of the people and to ensure the stability and efficacy of the union.

**Energy in the Executive**

Among the most fundamental of arguments in this discourse lies the principle that "energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government." Energy is essential to the protection of the community against external attacks; it is equally essential to the steady administration of the laws; to the protection of property and to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition, of faction, and of anarchy. Every government in which energy in the executive is lacking, will soon find itself mired in inefficacy and tumult.

**The Ingredients of Energy**

What constitutes the energy of the executive? There are four essential ingredients:

1. **Unity**: A single magistrate is far superior to a plural executive. Decision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch will all largely depend on the unity of the formal execution of governmental orders.

2. **Duration**: A longer term in office is conducive to the firmness and independence necessary to a President's confidence in his ability to carry out his constitutional duties.

3. **Adequate Provision for Support**: If the executive is properly compensated and funded, this will obviate any temptations to placate external forces, thus preserving integrity and independence.

4. **Competent Powers**: An effective executive must wield powers commensurate with the responsibilities imposed upon him. He must be empowered to execute the laws, conduct foreign policy, and safeguard the state against insurrection and invasion.

**Unity in the Executive**

Let us consider the first ingredient—unity. It is a matter of profound observance that a single executive has the advantage of enabling swift decisions which are critical in times of crisis. Without unity, divide and delay become brethren of governmental impotence.

Monarchical and despotic governments have historically paired unity with the terror of unbounded power. But our Constitution, furnishing checks and balances with its separation of powers, offers unity melded with accountability and restraint.

**Duration and Stability**

To the second point, duration in office provides the executive a vested interest in the nation’s long-term prosperity. It emboldens him to resist encroachments from the legislative branch—thus maintaining proper balance amongst our federal institutions.

Without sufficient tenure, the President could become susceptible to an over-reliance on the very legislature that may constrain his authority. This would undermine the independence so critical to effective leadership.

**Compensation and Provisions**

Thirdly, the executive’s compensation must be free from the manipulative whims of the legislative branch. If the legislature wields the power to diminish or suspend an executive’s remuneration, the President’s independence is directly compromised. Consequently, the Constitution rightly precludes any decrease in the executive's salary during the term of office.

**Empowering the Executive**

The final ingredient, competent powers, ensures that the executive can indeed fulfill the formidable responsibilities entrusted to him. This includes the implementation of laws, conduction of national defense and foreign policy. The executive must wield these authorities with judicious restraint, but also without the encumbrance of excessive checks that paralyze action.

**Conclusion: A Call for a Vigorous Executive**

In sum, a vigorous and empowered executive under the constraints of a republic—secured through unity, adequate tenure, proper compensation, and comprehensive power—is indispensable to the preservation of sovereignty, peace, and liberty. The contemplation and establishment of these principles represents a blend of practical governance and the philosophical commitment to the public welfare.

Thus, I submit to you, esteemed citizens, that the Constitution’s provisions regarding the executive are neither arbitrary nor capricious. They are founded upon reasoned principles driven by both historical insight and sagacious foresight. Let us, therefore, embrace the framework that promises a dynamic yet realigned executive, prepared to lead our nation towards greatness, justice, and enduring prosperity.
