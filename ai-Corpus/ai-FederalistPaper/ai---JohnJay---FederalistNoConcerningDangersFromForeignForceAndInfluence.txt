**FEDERALIST No. 2: Concerning Dangers from Foreign Force and Influence, 1787**

by John Jay

To the People of the State of New York:

It is with the weight of considerable concern that I address you on the pressing matter of foreign threats and intervention, a subject that should engage the vigilance and unanimity of every American citizen. Our infant nation, birthed from the travails of revolution and tempered by the ardor of liberty, now stands at a crossroads. As we, the people, endeavor to consolidate our nascent Union, we find ourselves not only tested by internal disagreements but also perennially watched by the ambitious eyes of foreign powers.

If there is a truth that should be universally acknowledged, it is that a fractured polity invites the injury of external manipulation. The annals of history bear stark testimony to the vicissitudes that befall disunited peoples. The dispersion of the ancient Greek states, notwithstanding their advancement in the arts and military prowess, precipitated their subjugation under the yoke of Macedon and later Rome. This exemplifies the perennial danger that fragmentation poses to sovereignty and liberty. 

It should, therefore, be manifest to all Americans that our collective security and prosperity lag upon our unity. A divided America would present itself as easy prey to foreign states, ever eager to widen their influence and dominion. How could we, in so divided a stance, negotiate our interests on equal terms with veteran and powerful nations? Our progeny would inherit a land not of independence and self-government, but one of subservience and external control.

Let us consider, specifically, the multifaceted forms through which foreign influence can penetrate a nation's fortifications. It can manifest under the guise of diplomacy, where treaties and negotiations, when conducted by disjointed states rather than a singular national entity, will invariably be manipulated to our detriment. Diverse and potentially conflicting state interests would precipitate diplomatic inconsistencies, undermining credibility and fostering discord. This disunity would invite foreign nations to play one state against another, thus eroding our collective bargaining power and compromising national integrity.

Moreover, the phenomena of intrigue and espionage serve as subtle yet potent vanguards of foreign interests. Agents of foreign potentates, cloaked in the vestments of commerce or even alliance, could exploit our divisions, sow discord, and extract covert influence over our political contingencies. The subtleties of influence wielded more insidiously than open force are no less detrimental to our self-determination.

A further point worthy of serious reflection is the susceptibility of a fragmented nation to outright military engagements. With multiple sovereignties, each maintaining its own militia and defenses, the defense of our nation would be disjointed and ineffective. In the face of foreign threats, a decentralized military structure is tantamount to inviting disaster.

To obviate these perils from foreign force and influence, we must, therefore, adopt a fortified structure of National Unity. A Confederated America, under a thoroughly-considered and strong Union, is our guerdon against subjugation and foreign dominance. It is not merely a theoretical ideal but a pragmatic necessity, ensuring that we stand as a single, formidable entity in the global arena, capable of defending our interests and upholding the principles of liberty and governance that we hold dear.

We must take to heart the wisdom of our forebears and the lessons of history; a Union, indissoluble and stalwart, guards against the machinations of foreign tyranny. Let us all pledge, without reservation, our fealty to this Union, so that the aspirations of our Revolution may be fully realized and the liberties of our people safeguarded against all external adversities.

Thus, let us band together with a resolute purpose to strengthen our Union, for therein lies our security and our future as a free and independent nation.

With all due respect, I remain, 

Your Obedient Servant,

John Jay
