**FEDERALIST No. 12: The Utility of the Union In Respect to Revenue, 1787**

From the New York Packet
Tuesday, November 27, 1787.

To the People of the State of New York:

Among the many advantages of our Union, none deserves more elucidation than its favorable aspect on the revenues of the Confederacy. It will be of peculiar utility in this respect. Indeed, it promises more effectually to secure the revenue from illicit practices, and more certainly to liberate the enterprise and industry of our citizens from the pernicious influence of unequal and oppressive taxes.

In the previous and various expostulations regarding the necessities of a strong Union under a capable federal government, much attention has been devoted to warfare, commerce, and the general welfare. Yet, the sinews of government—that which facilitates its functions and its very existence—is the revenue. Without ample resources, even the most enlightened system of government is rendered an impotent caricature of authority. 

The first object of a legitimate and just government is the provision for the common defense and general welfare. This cannot be pursued or accomplished without ample financial means. Under our confederation, the impotence of our fiscal policy stands as the most glaring indictment of its inadequacy. The states, isolated and incoherent in their approach to taxation, have fostered an inefficient and oftentimes corrupt system that stifles both the possibility of the collection and the spirit of national enterprise.

A well-constructed Union, capable of drawing forth and directing the wealth of the nation, in conformity with the sentiments and interests of the people at large, is indispensable for our prospective prosperity. The taxes which are the least burdensome, yet necessary and fruitful, are those which are diffused through a populous and industrious society and which are raised in such a uniform manner as to press as lightly as possible upon the resources of each individual. 

Consider the advantages which will attend the Union in the collection of revenues. The variety of taxes that the national government may adopt offers a mechanism for spreading the burden more equitably across those subject to its dominion. An aggregated system would place upon the government both the methodology and the scope necessary to impose a just and effective tax, proportionate to the wealth and consumption of its citizens. A single, unified government will surpass the efficacy of multiple local governments in its ability to monitor, regulate, and collect duties and imposts, diminish evasion, and enhance compliance.

The case of commerce is particularly illustrative. Our coasts and the length of our rivers offer extensive avenues for maritime traffic, bustling with mercantile activity. Yet under the current regime, the revenues derived from this source are minuscule, mired in systemic inefficiency and disparate state tariffs. The Union, through reasonable yet consistent duties on imports, stands to amplify these revenues exponentially. Moreover, the fair application of these duties across a collective entity will terminate the destructive competition and retaliatory trade policies witnessed among states which, in their jealous dissociation, act more to their detriment than advantage.

The collection of duties and the avoidance of smuggling will be rendered far more feasible under a federal aegis. With a national navy patrolling our waters and a standardized procedure for imposts, the deterrence against and punishment for evasion will uphold the integrity of our revenue system. The resources thus obtained will furnish not only the coffers of the state but enable comprehensive infrastructural and societal investments, which will, in turn, increase taxable wealth and enhance overall revenue.

Thus, in recognizing the indispensable value of a coherent and centralized federal authority for the collection and expansion of revenue, we secure the foundation upon which our government must rest. The reliance upon isolated state experiments in taxation and commerce has proven disastrous and must be superseded by a nationally unified and concerted effort. A flourishing revenue stream, nourished by a prudent, equitable, and universal federal tax regime, ensures the enduring viability and success of our great Union.

In summation, by cementing our states into a single, harmonious body politic, we cater not merely to the ephemeral needs of the present but lay the groundwork for protracted prosperity. The establishment of a comprehensive, federative system of taxation is as pivotal for our political welfare as securing our borders and maintaining civil order. It is through this lens that the utility of the Union, in respect to revenue, lays the bedrock for our aspirations and safeguards the future of this nation.

PUBLIUS.
