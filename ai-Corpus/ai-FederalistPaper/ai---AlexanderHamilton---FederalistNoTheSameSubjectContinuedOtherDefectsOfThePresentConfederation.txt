**FEDERALIST No. 22: The Same Subject Continued (Other Defects of the Present Confederation), 1787**  
**By Alexander Hamilton**

To the People of the State of New York:

In the continuation of the discussion on the imperfections of the present Confederation, I beg leave to expand upon additional facets wherein the framework of our existing union falters—thereby threatening the stability and prosperity of our nascent republic. As we persist in our dissection, we unveil deeper layers of structural incapacity which, if left unaddressed, could jeopardize the very essence of our sovereignty and national integrity.

One glaring inadequacy that warrants immediate rectification is the inefficacy of the Confederation to regulate commerce. The present design has left the individual states to operate under a decentralized and fragmented commercial policy, resulting in discordant trade regulations. The absence of a unified commerce directive incites perilous competition among states, fostering animosities and retaliation, which erode our economic cohesion. This obstacle not only debilitates interstate commerce but also weakens our position in foreign negotiations, as lack of uniformity exposes us to exploitation and diminishes our leverage on the international stage.

Furthermore, the incapacity of the existing government to levy and collect taxes directly from the people stands as a formidable defect. The reliance on requisitions from the states, which have proven to be both unreliable and untenable, undermines the federal government’s ability to furnish the essential needs of defense and administration. This financial impotence debilitates our capacity to secure public credit and enfeebles our military readiness, leaving us vulnerable to external threats and internal insurrections alike.

Another profound failing manifests in the cumbersome and inequitable nature of the legislative process under the Confederation. The requirement of a supermajority or sometimes unanimity to pass significant measures is a recipe for gridlock and inaction. This structural encumbrance paralyzes policy-making and emboldens a single recalcitrant state to obstruct the collective will. Such an arrangement is incompatible with efficient governance and necessitates a transition to a more balanced and executable legislative schema.

The judicial authority under the Confederation is another area of grave concern. The absence of a national judiciary to interpret laws uniformly and resolve interstate disputes leaves us adrift in a sea of legal inconsistency and fosters a climate of perpetual contention. A coherent judicial system is pivotal to maintaining the rule of law and ensuring fair adjudication across our union.

Additionally, the current structure prohibits the establishment of a potent executive authority capable of enforcing laws and administering the functions of government with efficacy and dispatch. The dilution of executive power among the states results in a lack of accountability and operational coherence, similar to the instability under the Articles of Confederation.

In summation, the exigencies of our time demand the fortification of our national framework. Only through the adoption of a robust central government can we envision a future of sustained unity, economic prosperity, and formidable national defense. The Constitution proposed by the recent convention in Philadelphia presents a beacon of reform, offering solutions to the multifaceted defects enumerated herein. It is incumbent upon us, the citizens of this republic, to embrace such a rectification, fostering a government that is capable, resilient, and reflective of the collective will.

Yours with unwavering conviction,

Publius (Alexander Hamilton)
