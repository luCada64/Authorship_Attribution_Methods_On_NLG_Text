**FEDERALIST No. 17: The Same Subject Continued (The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the Union), 1787**

Author: Alexander Hamilton

To the People of the State of New York,

In my previous discourse, I tragically and plainly laid bare the inherent weaknesses and the resultant inefficacies of the existing Confederation that binds these United States. Permit me to further elucidate why such a system is unable to uphold the prestigious union we so dearly cherish.

The gravamen of the matter rests on a fundamental principle of political science: the human penchant to gravitate towards sources of stability, prosperity, and protection. A central authority, devoid of necessary powers to enforce laws and deliver public goods across sovereign states, is impotent in administering enduring governance or maintaining public order. Hence, the present Confederation, which is in essence a loose alliance rather than a robust government, portends our downfall.

The inability of the Confederation to impose regulations upon constituent states effectively cultivates a self-destructive orbit of insubordination and disunity. It is a semblance of sovereign autonomy maintained at the danger of the general weal. States, driven by immediate local interests and rivalries, are disinclined to contribute equitably to the national treasury, execute federated policies, or furnish the army requisite to fend off common enemies. Such behavior is antithetical to the very idea of sacrosanct union.

Moreover, the lack of a potent central authority to regulate commerce—a lifeblood of national prosperity—prevents the states from attaining maximum economic potential. Each state, left to its own devices, devises policies beneficial solely to itself and invariably adverse to others, leading to an internecine commercial war, thus sacrificing collective wealth on the altar of provincial selfishness. 

Furthermore, the specter of insurrections looms large when local governments, inadequately fortified by a lack of centralized support, falter under internal dissent. History teaches that in such disarray, the seeds of tyranny are often sown under the pretext of re-establishing order. A divided house, unable to muster a cohesive defense or foster a spirit of national identity, inevitably invites foreign manipulation and domestic despotism.

Indeed, to persevere in this untenable structure is to consign our fledgling Republic to the fate of ancient confederacies which, valiant in principle, collapsed under the weight of internal discord and external aggression. The Amphictyonic League, the Achaean League, and the Helvetian Confederacy—these venerable associations, lacking central governance, perished in strife and subjugation. Shall we, having the benefit of such historical teachings, plunge heedlessly into the abyss they faced?

In conclusion, it remains imperative for us, earnest and enlightened citizens of this nascent Republic, to transcend parochial allegiances and fortify the bonds of our union through a revised structure of government. A constitution, empowering a central entity to harmonize the inherent diversity of our states, is indispensable to the sustenance of our liberty, security, and prosperity.

Thus, let us proceed with thoughtful deliberation and unwavering resolve toward the establishment of a government capable of preserving the union—not as a loose Confederation of discordant states, but as a robust, united Republic, resilient under the aegis of just law, and prospering in the common interest.

Yours with the highest consideration,

Publius
