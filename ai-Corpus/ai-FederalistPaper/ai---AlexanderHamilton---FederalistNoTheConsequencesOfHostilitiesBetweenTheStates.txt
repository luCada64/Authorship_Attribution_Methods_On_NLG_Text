**FEDERALIST No. 8: The Consequences of Hostilities Between the States, 1787**

by Alexander Hamilton

To the People of the State of New York:

In pursuance of the object which I have here proposed to myself, it naturally falls upon me to elucidate the consequences of hostilities arising between the independent States. The object appears to be of no inconsiderable magnitude, nor is it to be given a slightness of consideration that might prove derelict to our present endeavors. We must scrutinize with vigilance the potential discord that might ensue should our Union falter.

It is imperative to consider that if these States should, unthinkably, be disunited, the immediate consequence would be the introduction of conflicts of various natures. No one who has knowledge of human nature, the history of nations, and the ardor of faction could anticipate otherwise. Rivalries, heightened by pretensions of honor and sovereignty, would almost inevitably result in a state of hostilities that could prove subversive to the tranquility of the whole American continent.

Should the fabric of our Union be rent asunder, our situation would immediately resemble that of Europe; with its multiplicity of sovereignties, surmising enmities and hostilities, its entangled alliances, and its frequent wars. This is a fate from which we must diligent strive to avert our nascent nation, burgeoning with the virtues of liberty and the thirst for peace. The spectacle of a convulsed and divided America would not only wreak havoc upon the blessings we now afford but would assuredly lead to a progressive decay of our collective prosperity.

The immediate effect of hostile divisions would be the establishment of standing armies, the bane of liberty. Should one State arm itself, neighboring entities would follow suit in a stately dance of mutual apprehension. The adoption of militarism on a broad scale, made necessary by anarchy, would require the diversion of substantial resources and thereby deplete the wealth and vigor which could otherwise be devoted to industry and improvement.

Military despotism might ensue, as fearful States resultantly empower leaders to maintain order by arbitrary measures. Leaders who derive their strength from the exercise of force rather than the endorsement of the populace would rise, making mockery of the principles of republican governance. Those who fondly approve of a republican system of government for themselves need only look to the fate of divided Greece, whose once-flourishing republics fell to militaristic rulers through internal conflict, to discern the perils of disunion.

We must not be deluded by the vain hope that local conflicts would be brief or minor. The chronicles of Europe detail for us the extended campaigns and sustained animosities that can emerge from seemingly trifling disputes. The contentions among States, fostered by the anxieties and the jealousy among them, would not dissipate easily as they have the potential to become entangling and enduring.

Moreover, the commercial and civil relations among States would suffer irretrievably. A fractured Union would likely see commerce thwarted by various tariffs and restrictions designed to advantage one State over another. The prosperity that attends fair and unrestricted intercourse would dissipate, replaced by a state of grievances and retaliations that would impoverish the commerce of the entire American hemisphere.

The specter of war and the havoc it brings would make itself felt in more than the great arteries of State; it would cause abuses upon the peaceable and the powerless, it would disrupt the arts and sciences, diminish the fervor for education, and retard the moral refinement of our citizens. The terror of the sword within our territories would not only cause present suffering but sow the seeds of future calamity.

A Union, properly constituted and perpetuated, offers a palisade against such miseries. The consolidation of the States under a singular federal government presents a powerful shield against the encroachments of external enemies as well as the internal factions that might rend us asunder. The means provided by Union to avoid the evils of a disbanded continent are too substantial to be dismissed. To erect our defenses through unity, to promote our commerce and to preserve our liberties under one federal government is as rational as it is imperative.

Let us thus unite our efforts in seeing that the proposed Constitution is effectuated, ensuring that the propitious character of this nation is not shattered by the ambitions and the jealousies that lead to disunity. The maintenance of peace, the preservation of liberty, and the flourishing of our common republic demand no less of us.

In this enlightened era, let us embrace wisdom over pettiness, unity over fracture, and the bonds of fraternal harmony over the desolations of fraternal strife.

**Publius**
