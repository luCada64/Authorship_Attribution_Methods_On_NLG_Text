**FEDERALIST No. 77: The Appointing Power Continued and Other Powers of the Executive Considered.**

**Published on March 30, 1788**

To the People of the State of New York:

In the previous discourse, we have delved deeply into the structure and necessities of the appointing power vested within the Executive authority, illustrating its integral place within the framework of our nascent Republic. We now turn our consideration to the continued exploration of this power and its harmonious interconnection with the other plenary authorities ascribed to the Executive in the Constitution of the United States.

It has been well established that the Executive, as the guardian of the laws and protector of public welfare, must possess certain powers to execute the will of the people effectively. Among these, the appointing power stands paramount, for it ensures that individuals of merit and capability are placed in positions where their talents may be most serviceable to the nation. The proper administration of public affairs depends significantly on the discernment and rectitude employed in selecting appointed officials.

The dissenting voice may argue that such concentrated power, unmoderated and unchecked, could become the apparatus through which tyranny and cronyism flourish. To this, I concur that vigilance is indeed requisite; however, the framers of our Constitution have endowed Congress with the means to balance this authority. Through the advice and consent of the Senate, the Presidentâ€™s nominations for major offices are subjected to scrutiny, ensuring that appointments reflect not just the predilections of the Executive but also the collective wisdom of the representative body.

A noteworthy point of consideration within this framework is the removal of appointees. The Constitution grants to the Executive the authority to nominate and, with Senate consent, to appoint. It stands to reason that the power to remove should reside with the entity responsible for the initial appointment. This principle bolsters accountability, for the President, responsible for the fitness and propriety of appointments, must possess the accompanying authority to rectify errant or unsuitable assignments.

Critics posit that the Senate's involvement could encumber the flexibility and swiftness needed in certain exigencies; however, such checks are safeguards against imprudence and ensure that each appointment is meritorious and beyond reproach. In times of urgency, temporary and recess appointments provide the necessary latitude without compromising the vetting process essential for enduring placements.

Beyond appointments, the Executive's responsibilities manifest in the directive execution of the law, the command of the military forces, and the conduct of foreign relations. Each of these powers, though considerable, is intricately circumscribed by the constructs of accountability and oversight woven into the constitutional fabric.

Command of the military is entrusted to the President to ensure that our defense is agile, unified, and expeditiously directed. While the identify of Commander-in-Chief is intimidating in its strength, it is balanced by the power of Congress to declare war, appropriate funds, and regulate the armed forces. Such a conditional partnership ensures no single branch usurps the domain of another, ensuring liberty and security are concomitants of governance.

In the realm of foreign relations, the Executive holds the critical prerogative to represent and negotiate on behalf of the United States. Yet, the ratification of treaties is contingent upon the advice and consent of the Senate, requiring a supermajority vote. This stipulation prevents hastily contrived agreements that might imperil our sovereignty or contradict our foundational principles.

The blending of these potent authorities into a single Executive figure fosters unity and decisiveness, yet each power is meticulously channeled through republican principles ensuring the safekeeping of governmental balance and public trust.

In summation, our Constitution adroitly delineates an Executive endowed with requisite power to administer, protect, and promote the common good, while simultaneously embedding mechanisms of accountability and public service. The appointing power, like all Executive powers, must be judiciously executed, always with an eye towards virtue and the commonweal. The reciprocal dependence on the Senate ensures that appointments are neither reckless nor insular, reflecting a broad consensus infused with prudence.

Thus, let us recognize the balanced wisdom imparted by our framers, and continue to support the structures that undergird our fledgling republic. The harmony of a well-regulated Executive with a participatory, vigilant legislature embodies the essence of republican stability and the enduring safeguard of our liberties.

Your obedient servant,

ALEXANDER HAMILTON
