# FEDERALIST No. 24: The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered, 1787

By Alexander Hamilton

*To the People of the State of New York:*

It is both an honor and a duty to address the critical topic of our Union's ability to defend itself against the manifold perils that beset a fledgling nation. The foundation of any strong republic is the capacity to secure its own existence, to protect its citizens from external foes, and to uphold the principles of justice and liberty that underpin its social contract. Today, I shall elucidate upon the necessity of granting the federal government decisive powers for common defense and rectify the objections raised by those who stand contrary to a well-organized and ready national force.

The vigor of our common defense rests upon three essential pillars: the establishment of a permanent military force, the centralization of control over said force, and the provision of adequate resources for its maintenance and operation. To contest these propositions is to undermine the very safety and stability that we have striven so arduously to achieve through the framing of our Constitution.

**I. The Establishment of a Permanent Military Force**

The skepticism towards a standing army finds its roots in the historical abuses of monarchical regimes and their mercenaries. Yet, to neglect the establishment of a disciplined standing force is a perilous folly that exposes the nation to the caprices of hostile powers. In a world where despotism and ambition are ever ready to impinge upon the liberties of a nascent republic, it would be imprudent to rely solely upon a militia system, which, by its very nature, is ephemeral and subject to local allegiances and interests.

The exigencies of modern warfare demand preparation and proficiency, qualities that can only be cultivated through continuous training and organization. An army formed ad hoc, in moments of crisis, is akin to constructing a bulwark amidst a tempest; such a force would be fraught with inexperience, susceptible to the vicissitudes of fortune, and ultimately ineffective in its mandate to protect the state.

**II. The Centralization of Control over the Military**

Entrusting the power of command to a central authority is imperative for the coherent and effective deployment of our military capabilities. The federal structure advocated by the Constitution is uniquely positioned to oversee such operations, offering a unified strategy and direction that transcends parochial interests and regional biases.

Dissenters argue that vesting this authority in the federal government courts the danger of tyranny. However, the checks and balances intrinsic to our constitutional framework -- namely, the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches -- provide a bulwark against such overreach. Moreover, the vigilant oversight of an elected Congress ensures that the direction of military forces remains firmly aligned with the will of the people and the inviolable rights embedded in our law.

**III. The Provision of Adequate Resources**

A formidable military is not conjured from the ether; it requires sustenance in the form of financial resources, material, and manpower. The clauses of the Constitution that empower Congress to levy taxes and allocate funds for defense must be viewed not as instruments of oppression, but as vital mechanisms of national security.

Compromising on the fiscal needs of our military would be a grievous miscalculation, for an underfunded force is as impotent as none at all. The dilatoriness and dependency induced by the tardy or insufficient supply of resources could jeopardize our response to pressing threats, invite aggression from opportunistic adversaries, and sow domestic discontent.

**In Conclusion**

The need for a standing military force, centrally commanded and duly provisioned, is irrefutable in the face of the dangers that lie in wait at our borders and beyond. The architecture of our Constitution is thoughtfully designed to safeguard against the misuse of such powers, ensuring that our liberties remain inviolable even as we seek to protect them through might.

To forsake these essential pillars would be to imperil the very existence of our republic, exposing it to conquest and tumult. Let us not succumb to the siren song of complacency, nor be deterred by the specter of misuse that our prudent Constitution has resolved to dispel.

*Thus, let us proceed with the wisdom of preparation and the resolve of unity, forearming our nation against the uncertainties of a tumultuous world, and securing the blessings of liberty for generations yet to come.*
