**FEDERALIST No. 56: The Same Subject Continued (The Total Number of the House of Representatives), 1788**

To the People of the State of New York:

The question of the appropriate size of the House of Representatives is one that continues to generate earnest consideration and fervent debate among the enlightened citizens of this new republic. It is a matter of paramount importance, touching upon the very essence of our representative democracy and ensuring that the legislative body remains both effective and true to the principles of liberty and justice.

In previous discourses, the necessity of a sufficiently numerous House to reflect the wide array of interests and opinions within our expansive Union has been elucidated. Nevertheless, it remains imperative to further dissect the issue and justify the proposed frame under our new Constitution, which has settled on an initial apportionment that may be perceived as modestâ€”though mindful minds will recognize its balance and prudence.

When assessing the total number of the House of Representatives, three principal considerations demand our attention: the necessity for accurate representation, the capacity for the legislative body to deliberate effectively, and the importance of fostering a connection between the representatives and their constituents.

First, we must consider the ratio of representatives to the people. A primary purpose of republican government is to secure a true and effective representation of the populous. If too few represent too many, we risk the very bulwarks against tyranny that our Constitution is designed to establish. Yet, if too many hold seats, inefficiency and disorder threaten to undermine the legislative process itself. Expanded to an excessive degree, the House would become a babbling multitude, where unity and decisive action would be impossible.

The second consideration concerns the deliberative efficacy of the legislative body. A too-numerous House would inevitably devolve into confusion, where meaningful debate becomes lost amid a cacophony of voices. A streamlined yet competent assembly fosters clarity, precision in lawmaking, and the ability to grapple with intricate issues. It enables representatives to deliberate with greater focus and purpose, ensuring that both the spirit and letter of the law are crafted with the highest degree of sagacity possible.

Lastly, the proposed apportionment facilitates a vital connection between representatives and their constituents. Representation is not merely a matter of quantity; it extends to the quality of engagement and the extent to which representatives are acquainted with the local conditions and peculiar sentiments of their districts. A moderate number ensures that representatives can maintain a tangible and meaningful relationship with those they serve, thus embodying the very essence of republican virtue and accountability to the people.

Thus, the proposed number of the House at initiation is not a final dictum but a foundation upon which future expansions can be judiciously made. As our nation grows and the exigencies of the times evolve, the Constitution equips us with mechanisms to enlarge the body as needed, ensuring continual alignment with the principles of just and effective representation.

In conclusion, the foundational number initially chosen by the framers balances the three critical considerations articulated: accurate representation of the people, efficacy in legislative deliberation, and fostering a proximate relationship between representatives and their constituents. It is a thoughtful calibration, designed with both the present conditions and future adaptability in mind. Let us, therefore, proceed with confidence that the structure we establish today will serve as a bulwark for liberty and an engine of sound governance as we collectively venture forth into the grand experiment of self-rule.
