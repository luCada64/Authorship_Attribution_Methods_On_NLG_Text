To the People of the United States:

In the catalog of specious arguments against the proposed Constitution, there is none more preposterous than the suggestion that the legislative authority should be restrained in matters pertaining to the common defense. This notion, seemingly rooted in a mistrust of representative government, threatens to undermine the very foundation of our nation's security.

It is crucial to understand that the primary object of civil government is the protection and security of the community. In every political society, the means to attain this end must necessarily vary with the circumstances under which the society finds itself. The insufficiency of existing structures to provide complete security was a paramount motive for convening the Constitutional Convention, and the resultant plan seeks to correct these deficiencies with prudent foresight.

Critics who advocate for arbitrary limitations on the legislative power fail to consider the very nature of legislative responsibility. The powers of the legislature in a free nation must be framed in such a manner as to adapt to an infinite variation of situations. Circumstances may arise which no human foresight can predict, encompassing foreign invasions, domestic insurrections, or other exigencies, which will demand a decisive and immediate exercise of comprehensive authority.

The argument that the legislative body may resort to tyrannical measures in the provision of the common defense, though fundamentally apprehensive, cannot justify preemptive fetters on such a vital aspect of governance. The preservation of liberty necessitates a government competent to defend itself and its citizens. History attests, particularly in the annals of empires fallen by the hand of their own impotence, that overweening restrictions invite disaster.

We must, therefore, regard the legislative power with the gravity and trust it deserves. The representatives, being chosen by the people, are no less than the people's watchmen, stewards of our collective safety. To deny them the unhampered authority required for defensive measures would not merely be a disserviceâ€”it would constitute a reckless endangerment of the republic itself.

One must recall the incapacity of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation to command the resources critical to the defense during the recent revolution. Their noble but ineffectual attempts, stifled by a lack of enforcement powers, resulted in debilitating scarcities and operational delays that nearly cost us our hard-fought independence. Are we to resurrect these inadequacies in a new guise?

Furthermore, the Constitution proposes a system of checks and balances, ensuring that the legislative assembly cannot, without the concurrence of additional, independent branches, impose any potential usurpations. Wisely constructed are these layers of oversight which separate and counterbalance powers, mitigating against any potential descent into despotism while safeguarding responsive governance.

In conclusion, when visions of liberty are overshadowed by well-meaning yet miscalculated constraints, the ensuing fragility endangers what we seek most to preserve. Let us recognize the proper scope of legislative authority as delineated by the Constitution, embracing it as both necessary and just, ensuring our common defense with all the strength and efficacy required by the dynamism of the times.

The proposed Constitution, by entrusting the legislative body with appropriate, unshackled powers concomitant with their high duties, presents an edifice capable of both protecting civil liberties and ensuring national security. Let us not falter by encumbering it with impractical and perilous restraints.

Your faithful servant,
Alexander Hamilton
