**FEDERALIST No. 51: The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments**

**Published 1788**

To the People of the United States:

In the continuous effort to explain the principles which uphold the Constitution, we turn our discourse today to the vital mechanism that ensures its enduring precincts: the system of checks and balances. It is with this structuring principle that the preservation of liberty, as well as the advancement of justice, is most securely fortified.

The complexity of government arises from the necessity that it must control the governed; and at the same time, be obligated to control itself. For it is an indelible truth, attributable to the very nature of man, that persons in positions of power—left unchecked—may perpetuate their own ascendancy and subjugate those whom they are to serve. Thus, it is paramount that the structure of the government must be so contrived as to fulfill two desiderata: to ensure the separate and distinct existence of the different branches, and to harness their mutual coaction as a means of preventing overreach.

The Constitution's design treats human nature with a healthy skepticism, understanding that ambition must be made to counteract ambition. Within this framework, each division of power—legislative, executive, and judicial—must be enabled with the requisite constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. It is precisely by so regulating these interdependencies that a balance is struck. For this reason, detailed provisions form the very heart of our governing charter.

The legislative authority predominates in a republican government, but to maintain equilibrium, it must be further divided into separate branches that are distinct yet interdependent. This division mitigates the legislative body's potential to tyrannize, since internal frictions within the legislature will prevent hasty and ill-considered aggregation of dominance. Each branch is designed with a degree of autonomy such that neither may subsume the function of the other.

Parallel to the division of the legislature, the executive and judiciary must also be fortified against usurpations. A robust executive fortified with veto power stands as a sentinel against legislative overreach. Yet so too the permanence and independence of the judiciary is indispensable in the defense of private rights against the passions of majorities. Their life-tenured vigor secures their fealty not to transient masters but to the enduring framework of the Republic.

Yet internal checks alone may not suffice. External mechanisms are also necessary. Federalism, by providing multiple layers of government, ensures that the powers delegated to the national government are limited and specific, all other powers being reserved to the states or to the people. This vertical separation ensures a double security to the rights of the people. The different governments will control each other, at the same time that each will be controlled by itself.

Moreover, civil society must forever be vigilant. The experience of oppression is often preceded by the erosion of liberties under the guise of necessity. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. Citizens are enjoined to be ever mindful and to hold their public servants to the standards that ensure an open and just government.

In conclusion, the structure of government set forth by our Constitution precisely anticipates the fallibility of men and the hazards of concentrated power. It equips our Republic with a system whereby ambition can be made to counteract ambition, ensuring that men are kept virtuous by necessity rather than by extraordinary virtue—a more reliable bulwark for enduring freedom.

This is the design: an intricate arrangement reflective of profound wisdom and cautious trust. Such balance does it strike that we have sufficient reason to hope, and clear obligation to strive, for its preservation and success.
