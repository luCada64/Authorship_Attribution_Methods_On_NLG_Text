Oh listen while I sing to thee, 
In shadows deep and twilight's veil, 
Where whispers roam both wild and free, 
And night's lament doth softly wail.

From caverns where the echoes sleep, 
In tone with spectral memory, 
A tale of yore I vow to keep, 
Oh listen while I sing to thee.

The moon doth rise with silvered grace, 
Adorning skies with ghostly light, 
As phantoms of a vanished race 
Embrace the gloom of endless night.

In dreams where sorrow's tendrils weave, 
A tragic hymn of loss and rue, 
Let my mournful song bereave, 
And stir the soul within you, too.

Oh soul who walks the midnight drear, 
Where shadowed paths entwine the heart, 
In this lament thine anguish hear, 
A melody that ne'er shall part.

Dost thou recall, when spring was sweet, 
And hope adorned thy youthful brow? 
Yet fate and time didst cruelly meet, 
To forge the bond 'twixt then and now.

Now let the cold and dark descant 
Be notes that echo endlessly, 
For in this sorrowed, solemn chant, 
Oh listen while I sing to thee.

Thus mourn we through the veil of time, 
For moments lost, forever gone, 
And in the dark, with this harsh rhyme, 
A requiem shall linger on.

The winds of fate, they cruelly blow, 
Unyielding in their bitter course, 
Yet 'tis in sorrow, we may know, 
The depth of love's eternal force.

So whilst the night doth round us cling, 
And stars their mournful vigils keep, 
With trembling heart, oh let me sing, 
And cradle thee in mourning's sleep.

Oh listen while I sing to thee, 
This dirge that time cannot eraseâ€” 
A tale of pain, eternity, 
In shadows, love and death embrace.
