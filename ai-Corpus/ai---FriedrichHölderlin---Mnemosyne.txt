**Mnemosyne**

In the quietude of twilight's grace,
Where mountains whisper to the falling sun,
A memory stirs within the heart's embrace,
Timeless, as though eternity begun.

Oh Muse of Time, Mnemosyne divine,
Through you, the past and present intertwine,
In spectral verses of celestial rhyme,
The echoes of existence so refine.

On rivers of forgetfulness, we sail,
Yet anchored by your luminous decree,
In fleeting moments, epics do prevail,
A hymn of stars, forever meant to be.

The ancient woods, enraptured by your song,
Bend with the weight of seasons long gone by,
Their leaves, like pages, chronicling the throng
Of lives that dance beneath your watchful eye.

Oh, how the fleeting years dissolve in mist,
Yet in your depths, the truth is crystal clear,
Within your arms, no memory is missed,
Eternal is the song you let us hear.

Through dream and shadow, wanderer forlorn,
Seeks solace in the laughter of the days,
When time's cruel hand had yet to be reborn,
In cycles of unending, boundless praise.

The night reveals the cosmos, dark and deep,
And stars, like whispers, paint the velvet sky,
So too, do we in shadowed silence keep
The fragments of a tale that cannot die.

Mnemosyne, in you, the ages blend,
The endless dance of morning and of night,
Through you, forgotten names and faces mend
In your embrace, the world is made aright.

Thus, let the sacred torch of memory burn,
With flame that neither dawn nor dusk consumes,
In every heart, your ardor we discern,
As time flows, still your timeless light illumes.
