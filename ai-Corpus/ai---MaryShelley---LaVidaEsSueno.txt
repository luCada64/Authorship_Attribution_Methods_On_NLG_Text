**La Vida es Sueño**

In shadows deep, where phantoms tread,
A twilight world where hope has fled,
I wander through a spectral dream,
In search of truths, though vague they seem.

The heavens weep with silent rue,
As mist enshrouds the morning dew,
Each star, a whisper yet untold,
Of destinies both young and old.

Bewitched, the night unfolds its veil,
And whispers secrets, dark and frail,
Were these but visions, fleeting, numb,
Or destinies that never come?

For in this web, where dreams are spun,
The harsh domain of life’s begun,
Yet, what is life but dreams’ embrace,
A fleeting waltz through time and space?

Upon the shore, where waves collide,
This fragile mire where fears abide,
I cast my heart, a trembling plea,
To realms unseen, where dreams run free.

Oh, life! A shadow’s fleeting breath,
Companioned by the visage, Death,
Yet, in its grasp, a gentle beam,
For life, immutable, a dream.

Endless falls the night of yore,
With specters crowding evermore,
Yet dawn returns with feeble sheen,
Evoking worlds that might have been.

Thus, I, adrift on seas delayed,
Confront the dawn with dreams arrayed,
For life’s cruel jest, a phantom’s growl,
Echoes softly, life’s disavow.

So tread we must, in soft despair,
Through dreams entwining, everywhere,
La Vida es Sueño, whispered low,
A spectral waltz, through time's tableau.
