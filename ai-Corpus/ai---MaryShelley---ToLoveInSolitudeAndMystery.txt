To Love in Solitude and Mystery

In yon deserted glade, where shadows play,  
Where time's unyielding hand hath left no trace,  
I walk alone whilst twilight fades to gray,  
And silence weaves its shroud o’er nature's face.  

Oft did my heart seek solace 'midst the throng,  
Yet found no joy, no peace, but ceaseless strife;  
The crowded halls of men, with clamorous song,  
Gave naught but fleeting whispers of true life.  

In solitude, 'midst whispering boughs of night,  
Where phantasms drift with moonbeams o'er the lea,  
There lies a realm unseen by mortal sight,  
A world entwined with love and mystery.  

To love in silence, where no eyes intrude,  
Where every sigh is but a breeze’s moan,  
Is to clasp close the infinite and brood,  
Upon the boundless depths of love alone.  

As mist enfolds the lake in ghostly veil,  
So doth my spirit yearn for that unseen,  
To feel the tender graze of love's soft trail,  
In realms where shadows dance and all is serene.  

O, ethereal night, thy sable wings extend,  
Embrace me in thy arcane, tender grasp;  
Let love's unspoken breath my being blend,  
With mystic dreams, in sweet, eternal clasp.  

Thus hidden from the world, unseen, unknown,  
I find my heart's true home, where wonders be;  
To love in solitude and mystery, alone,  
Is to dwell in the purest ecstasy.
