**Looking Outward**

By valleys deep, where shadows play,
In twilight's grasp, my heart does stray,
O distant peaks, like whispers keen,
In realms unknown, what have you seen?

The river's course, in silver twine,
With secrets old, its waters pine,
To lands afar, where dawns alight,
In dreams we sail, through endless night.

The azure skies, in solemn grace,
Reflect the soul's untethered chase,
What truths, unbound, in distant loam,
In foreign soil, shall we call home?

Oh, winds that stir the ancient boughs,
And whisper soft, of sacred vows,
Guide us through the veils of time,
To realms where stars in silence chime.

Yet, as we gaze, with yearning clear,
The world within is ever near,
For in each heart, a universe,
With boundless love, does life immerse.

So let us tread, both near and far,
To lands unknown, where wonders are,
With open eyes, and spirits free,
May we become what we must see.
