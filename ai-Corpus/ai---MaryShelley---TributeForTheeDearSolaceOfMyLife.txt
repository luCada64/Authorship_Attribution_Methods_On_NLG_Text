Tribute for thee dear solace of my life

In this nocturne, bound by timorous light,
Shall I inscribe, in ink of liquid night,
A tribute for thee, dear solace of my life,
Amidst the tremor of a world of strife.

When shadows dense enshroud the distant shore,
And silent winds through cedar branches bore,
Thy visage, fair, emerges from the shade,
A beacon cast in time’s relentless trade.

Oh, comfort sweet, in thine embrace I dwell,
A sanctuary in this earthly shell,
From tempest wild and mortal’s roiling plight,
Thou art the calmly kindled star of night.

The autumn leaves, their golden whispers speak,
Of seasons past, their traces faint and meek,
Yet thee, perennial, in thine arm’s embrace,
Dost weave eternity with gentle grace.

In piercing storms, in shrill and banshee cries,
When specters pale ascend the raven skies,
Thou art the haven, steadfast and profound,
An anchor sure, when restless tides abound.

To thee, I owe my breath, my quickened pulse,
The fervor in my soul dost thou convulse,
For in thine eye, the tenderest of gleams,
Lie waking life, and dreams within their dreams.

Oh, solace, love, in thee such bright repose,
As moonlight lays upon the thorn and rose,
In thee I find the balm for endless woe,
A beacon bright where mortal fears do go.

In whispers will I pledge my fealty true,
For thee, my solace, skies are ever blue,
Though epochs hence might speak of weary plight,
Thy spirit’s warmth eclipses twilight’s blight.

Together bound, in realms of amaranth light,
Through veils of time, through dawn and deepest night,
A tribute written in celestial ink,
To thee, dear solace, on eternity’s brink.

Through every age, through every fleeting bloom,
Though mortal life inhabit fleeting tomb,
Forevermore in shadows and in gleaming,
In thee, dear solace, endless is our dreaming.
