**Bread And Wine**

Unknown Year

O gentle warmth of simple days,
Where earth’s rich bounty lays its claim,
In fields where golden sheaves must raise
And sunbeams whisper ancient names.

Behold the village, humble, quaint,
Where vine and wheat together grow,
A timeless grace no pen can paint,
In shadows where the spirits flow.

Oh gentle gods, a fleeting wind,
Enlighten us with nature’s truth,
For in your gaze, the world has sinned
By trading age for fleeting youth.

Where is the sacred? Lo, it hides,
In bread’s dear crust, in wine’s deep blush,
And parting clouds unveil besides,
The quiet heartbeat of the hush.

Encircled by these sacred lands,
The world in silence, still and broad,
We raise our bread with reverent hands,
And sip our wine in thought of God.

What have we lost, what have we gained?
The stars above, the earth below,
The wine’s sweet spirit unrestrained,
In every drop, the ages flow.

From vineyard laugh and harvest cheer,
The secret of the mortal plight,
As bread and wine, both linger near,
Did bless our souls with fleeting light.

Unknown and known, the pathways twist,
Yet ‘midst the labyrinth of time,
The simplest truths we can’t resist—
In humble fare, there bides the rhyme.

How clear the heavens when we see,
Beyond the fleeting, ephemeral,
In bread and wine our spirits free,
To grasp the everlasting whole.

So let us drink, and break the crust,
From golden grain to crimson vine,
In memory of dreams and dust,
We find the sacred, bread and wine.
