**Ode to Ignorance**

O Ignorance! thou shroud of gentle sleep,
That wraps the world in shadows deep and wide,
Thou art the stagnant pool, whose waters keep
Reflections false, where Truth can never bide.

The mind, enrapt in numbing, blissful cloud,
Finds solace in the night of thine embrace.
A tranquil veil where voices are too loud,
Subdued, and lost in Time's unending race.

Thy semblance as a friend, so coy and meek,
Entices weary souls to rest in peace.
Foresight and reason, attributes so sleek,
Are but the lamentations that shall cease.

Yet in thine arms, no beacon eâ€™er shall shine
To lift the veil of apathy bestowed.
Thy boundless reign, perchance is too divine,
That steers our fragile vessel off the road.

O sweet delusion! Heaven in disguise,
Enchain not hearts with thy deceitful plea.
The dawn of wisdom brightens darkened skies,
And sets the dormant mind eternally free.

Then shall the soul, unburdened from thy snare,
Take flight to realms of boundless thought and might.
True knowledge is our beacon, pure and fair,
To lead us from the ignorance of night.

Mary Shelley
