**As On A Holiday**

In tender hours spun by the light of dawn,
When sylvan whispers tease the ear of morn,
I wander as on holiday, forlorn,
Through elysian fields by nature drawn.

Oh, to grasp the fleeting world anew,
As painted skies embrace the verdant earth,
And rivers sing a song to lovers true,
In harmony with joy, and tender mirth.

Beneath the canopy of ancient trees,
Their boughs enraptured by the sun's sweet kiss,
I breathe the essence of the sacred breeze,
A gentle hymn that greets the soul’s abyss.

Here time suspends its relentless decree,
Unfold the dreams entwined with sacred chains,
Where shadows dance in endless revelry,
Untroubled by the world’s ephemeral gains.

In tranquil silence, mankind's fears dissolve,
As nature’s splendor weaves its golden thread,
To bind the heart in love’s celestial solve,
And lift the weary spirit from the dead.

So wander we, as on this holiday,
Though years unknown may soften memory's trace,
Yet in our hearts, forever shall it stay,
The echo of a dear and holy place.

Thus may we live, in quiet homage paid,
To verdant fields and skies of azure hue,
Embracing every tender escapade,
As on a holiday, both bright and true.
