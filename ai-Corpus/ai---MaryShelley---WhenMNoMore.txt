When I no more beheld the morn's first light,
In dales somber and valleys veiled in night,
Ere the moon's wan glow serenades the wight,
And stars whisper secrets old, pure in their flight,

My spirit lingers where yon shadows creep,
With angels unseen who o'er my tomb weep.
The tendrils of fate in twilight so deep,
Entwine the dreams we mortal sow and reap.

Oh, spectres of memory, unveil thy shroud,
Raise not your hollow voices bold and proud.
For in the echo of love, neither taught,
'Tis where my soul to tranquil rest is brought.

Through this unsparing sphere of dark lament,
Where whispers linger of dreams long spent,
When shadows dance in celestial lament,
There I abode, my fatal heart's intent.

Hark, the harp that rings 'neath heaven's dome,
In melodies that ceaselessly do roam.
When I no more, 'tis there I'll find my home,
In realms untethered, free from dread and moan.

Thus, we part, O world of constant fray,
From my worn breast, let sorrow drift away.
In darkened woods where once the skylarks play,
I'll sleep in peace till that eternal day.
