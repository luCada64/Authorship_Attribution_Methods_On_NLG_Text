On Reading Wordsworth’s Lines on Peele Castle (1825)

As tempest's breath rends azure skies apart,
And dark waves lash at fortressed solitude,
So stirs the verses inked by poet’s art,
Awakening my soul in somber mood.

O solemn bastion, where wild tempests rage,
And seas embolden rocky sentinels,
In Wordsworth's ink, thy storm becomes a stage,
Where nature's wrath with human sorrow dwells.

Thy walls, stronghold against merciless time,
Stand vigilant o’er waters deep and cold,
Yet 'tis within thy ruin, lays the rhyme,
A tale of loss by silent grief retold.

Each wailing gust and mournful whisper'd knell,
Within those stanzas resonates with mine,
For I have wandered 'midst the barren fell,
And seen despair where once did hope entwine.

A murky pall doth hang ‘pon memories,
The bitter storm mirrors a heart that mourns,
In Wordsworth’s lines, each cresting wave agrees,
The past is shattered, and the future scorns.

Yet, ‘mid the thunder’s roar and gale’s embrace,
A vestige of defiance lingers still,
For in those stones, I trace a human face,
One that, like mine, dared fate to test its will.

Thus, as the Castle weathers swift decay,
So must we stand, though beaten by the storm,
And in the poet’s timeless elegy,
Find strength within our lament to transform.

By candle’s flicker, with a weary hand,
These verses I inscribe with solemn care,
For nature’s wrath and time’s devouring sand,
Unveil the depths of mortal heart laid bare.

And though the tempest yet may rend our peace,
In Wordsworth's lines, a solemn truth unsealed:
That even in destruction, there’s release,
A poignant beauty in our wounds revealed.
