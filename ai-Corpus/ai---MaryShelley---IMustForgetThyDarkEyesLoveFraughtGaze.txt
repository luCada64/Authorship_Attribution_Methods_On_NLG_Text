In solemn shadows, where the moonlight wanes,
And echoes of lost whispers haunt the air,
There lies a pain few hearts may dare to name,
A torment born of beauty, dark and rare.

I must forget thy dark eyes’ love-fraught gaze,
That pierce my soul with passions unrestrained,
And wrench my heart through endless, lonely days,
With memories of the love that we've profaned.

Like phantoms in the mist, thy eyes appear,
In every twilight's breath they softly call,
Yet fate, so cruel, now sows its seeds of fear,
And I am bound to mourn our love's downfall.

Enchanted moments, drenched in shadow’s veil,
Where worlds we made from dreams did rise and fall,
Now lie in ruins, tales of love grown stale,
A testament to passion’s fleeting thrall.

Oh cruel remembrance, why dost thou torment,
With specters of a gaze that once was mine?
Shall I consign our vows to dark lament,
And in oblivion seek peace divine?

Yet as the night with silent sorrow weeps,
And morning’s promise wanes without a trace,
I find no solace in these thorn-choked sleeps,
Nor can I bear a world void of thy face.

Thus, as the stars scrawl prophecies on high,
And winds lament in mournful, soft malaise,
I whisper to the void, a mournful sigh:
"I must forget thy dark eyes’ love-fraught gaze."
