"Human Applause"

In the twilight glow of autumn’s eye,
Where river Hymns unto the vale,
The mortal echo does arise,
And upon the winds does sail.

Ancient whispers, frail yet strong,
Beneath the canopy of stars,
Reverberate — the human song,
In harmony with fleeting scars.

O, the heavens bent down low,
Listening to ephemeral praise,
From voices lost and yet, they sow
The seeds of dawn in countless ways.

Through verdant fields and shadowed grove,
Where time, relentless specter, roves,
The sound of cheer, both near and far,
Is mirrored in each trembling star.

Yet transient is the crown we wear,
As day gives way to shadowed night,
In fragile breaths of autumn air,
We seek our place in celestial light.

Thus, let the chorus softly fade,
Into the ether, bound and free,
For in each heart, a note is made,
A part of life's vast symphony.

In silence, let the echoes rise,
To realms where time will never pause,
And though unseen by earthly eyes,
Lives on the song — human applause.
