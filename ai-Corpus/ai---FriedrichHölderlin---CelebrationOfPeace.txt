Celebration Of Peace

O gentle hills that know the breath of spring,
Where ancient rivers hum their timeless tune,
Lift up your verdant crowns and let us sing,
For peace has come beneath the silver moon.

In valleys where the whispering breezes play,
And sunbeams kiss the earth with tender grace,
The harbingers of dawn proclaim the day,
When hearts unburdened find their sacred space.

No more the clashing of the fiery sword,
No more the cries that pierce the tranquil night,
The weary hearts, in harmony restored,
Bathe in the glow of freedom's tender light.

The stars, like sentinels in azure skies,
Bear witness to our vow of unity,
Where once was sorrow, now calm beauty lies,
A testament to love’s infinity.

O ancient oak, whose roots embrace the past,
And bear the tale of centuries untold,
Stand tall and bear our dreams so nobly cast,
In arms of ages, timelessly enfold.

Let every brook and meadow, every stone,
Resound the hymn of peace that we now raise,
By heaven’s gift, by earth’s embrace, our own,
In one pure voice shall echo endless praise.

For in this sigh of nature’s deep accord,
In every gentle breeze, in rain’s reprieve,
We find the language of a love restored,
In tranquil moments, sacredly we breathe.

Fleet moments, grasped within eternity,
In blissful silence mark this blessed hour,
All hearts united, gentle harmony,
Beneath the gaze of heaven’s watchful power.
