For Zimmer

In Zimmer's solitude the echoes lie,
Soft shadows dance where once the sun was bold,
The room, a silent witness, heaves a sigh,
As whispers of the past their secrets hold.

The walls enclose a tapestry of dreams,
Each woven thought a thread of golden hue,
A symphony where light and darkness gleams,
Revealing worlds both distant and anew.

Oh, hallowed space, where soul and spirit blend,
Where time and memory find gentle rest,
In your embrace, the stars and earth descend,
To mingle in a dance both pure and blessed.

Yet, Zimmer’s heart does yearn for dawn anew,
For whispers of the wind and morning's grace,
Though shadows cast a veil of somber hue,
In silence blooms the hope—unseen, in place.

Here nature sings within the still confines,
Her voice a balm to weary, questing mind,
In every leaf and breeze her pattern finds,
A hymn of peace, eternal and refined.

Thus, in this sacred haven, dreams ascend,
A sanctuary wrought by quiet hands,
Where love and loss and beauty gently blend,
As Zimmer’s fleeting time in twilight stands.

For though the year may rest in shadows deep,
The spirit’s song in Zimmer is alive,
Through corridors of night, it softly sweeps,
Awaiting dawn where truth and love revive.
