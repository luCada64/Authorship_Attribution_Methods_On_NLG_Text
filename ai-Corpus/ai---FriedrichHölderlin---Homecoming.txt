**Homecoming**

In twilight’s tender embrace, I wander,
Silent whispers of eons past,
Where golden meadows humbly cast,
Their gentle light upon my soul.

O distant hills, crowned with ancient grace,
Do you remember the footsteps,
Of a heart once astray,
Yet yearning for the solace of home?

The river, a sapphire ribbon,
Weaves through the tapestry of time,
Its endless song a hymn,
To the forgotten dreams of youth.

Majestic trees, ageless sentinels,
Guardians of sacred earth,
You cradle in your shadowed arms,
The slumber of forgotten years.

O homeland, wherein lies the breath
Of my creation, cradle and grave,
I return to your hallowed breast,
With the reverence of a son.

Here, under the cerulean arch,
Where the larks do sing,
And the winds whisper tales,
I find my heart unburdened.

For in this sacred bosom,
Unfurl the petals of recollection,
And in the sanctuary of your fields,
I am reborn in grace and peace.

Thus, in the twilight’s tender arms,
The wanderer finds his rest,
And the spirit of the infinite,
Dwells once more in the embrace of home.
