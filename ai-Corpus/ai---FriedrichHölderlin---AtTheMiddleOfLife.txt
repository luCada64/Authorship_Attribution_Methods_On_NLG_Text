**At The Middle Of Life**

In trust the golden age advances close,
The morning whispers, gentle zephyrs play,
Yet shadows form where once resplendent glows,
To guide me through the somber twilight’s sway.

The rivers of my youth now murmur low,
Their melodies no longer echo pure;
A tranquil sigh, the whispers soft bestow
A measure metered by the heart's contour.

The lofty heavens stretch with azure grace,
Their vault reflecting memories once bright,
Where dreams now weave a more subdued embrace,
And starlit aspirations cast their light.

O soul, in reverence, the path still walks,
Between the dawn and dusk's ephemeral frame,
And wisdom in the tempered silence talks,
A tranquil truth that time and love proclaim.

What blooms unseen, where shadows meet the sun?
Where seasons turn, and autumn holds its sway?
'Tis there mid-life, the second act's begun,
A gentle pause along the winding way.

Oh Nature, keeper of enigmatic truth,
In tender melodies your mysteries hold,
The spring-like fervor, as in fleeting youth,
Revives with fervor in hearts grown bold.

At the middle mark, the summit’s gentle crest,
I stand and contemplate the world’s expanse,
With gratitude for all both cursed and blessed,
For fleeting moments, and for love’s warm dance.

Thus, knowing well one's temporal domain,
In middle life, the balance true maintains,
The gift of time, a trust devoid of stain,
A sacred pause where peaceful glory reigns.
