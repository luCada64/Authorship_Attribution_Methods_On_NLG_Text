In twilight's shroud and mournful breath,
Where shadows cloak the glen,
I wander in a world bereft,
Bereaved of love, and then—
Where once thy footsteps graced the moor,
Now absent as the moon's pale glow,
I seek the whisper of yore,
In winds that through the hollows blow.

Oh, cruel absentia, thy dark embrace
Hath wrought upon my soul's deep core,
A gulf no stars can e'er efface,
Nor time's swift current restore.
For absence is a hollowed grave,
A chasm wide, a boundless sea,
Where hopes like fleeting phantoms rave,
And dreams like spectres cease to be.

In labyrinths of loss I tread,
Each path a mirror of despair,
Where once thy gentle light was spread,
Now only shadows linger there.
Yet, through the veils of sorrow's night,
A flicker faint, a candle's plea,
Recalls to me thy visage bright,
A memory that bids me flee.

From realms where absence reigns supreme,
To shores where love may brightly burn,
As in a long-forgotten dream,
I yearn for thee; for thee I yearn.
Though distance holds its cruel sway,
And time's relentless arms enfold,
My heart, in constancy, will stay,
In absence—ever bold.
