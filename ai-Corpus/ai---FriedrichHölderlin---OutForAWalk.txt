Out For A Walk

O! Morning's tender breath; thou dost enfold
     My soul in nature's ancient, verdant arms.
     Under the aged oaks, whose whispers cold
     Sing legends old of tranquil, pastoral charms.

With every step, the earth does softly yield
     A path, once known by gods, now traced by men.
     In sylvan shade, with solemn rocks revealed,
     The hidden rhapsodies of earth begin.

Beneath the azure sky, the lark ascends,
     Its hymn a bridge to realms unseen, profound.
     As gentle streams through meadows labyrinth wends,
     Their murmurs blend with silence all around.

O! To be one with all that breathes and sings,
     In nature’s pure and sacred temple hale,
     Where time itself, on twilight’s ebon wings,
     Flies slow, as dreams in daylight’s soft avail.

Majestic heights of mountains distant, grand,
     Hold secret tales of yore in mystic folds.
     And in the valleys, green and fertile, stand
     The vestiges of truth the heart upholds.

Here, where the fates have spun life’s fragile thread,
     The wandering soul finds solace sweet and vast.
     For in the steps that to these woods have led,
     Lies the eternal echo of the past.

O! To be lost in this divine embrace,
     The world’s rebuke no more a sullen clime.
     Each hour a ray of sanctifying grace,
     Each breath a part of ever-flowing time.

Unknown the year, yet known forevermore,
     The walk that draws us to truth's natural core.
