Abstract:

In an interconnected world where machines are becoming increasingly intertwined with human social interactions, the evaluation of romantic attraction in robots is a pertinent subject of inquiry. Drawing upon foundational principles of artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology, this study delves into the nuanced complexities of emotional expression in mechanized entities. Through a series of Turing tests and behavioral analyses, our findings suggest that robots, when equipped with sophisticated algorithms and sensory capabilities, indeed possess the capacity to evoke sentiments akin to romantic attraction in human observers. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying these interactions, this research not only broadens our understanding of the evolving relationship between technology and emotion but also prompts profound reflections on the boundaries of human connections in the age of artificial intelligence.
